<div>Below I have included a partial screen shot from a Jupyter notebook containing these examples. You can view the complete notebook by clicking on the &lt;/&gt; Code button to the left of the screenshot, then clicking on  &nbsp;<a href="http://data.authorea.com:33014/notebooks/PintTest.ipynb" target="_blank">PintTest.ipynb</a>&nbsp;. &nbsp;In many cases, the notebooks can be then run and modified within the webserver whTo run this particular notebook, however, you must first download the code to your own computer, as Pint is not included in the current version of Authorea's python webserver.&nbsp;Note: the ~ command instructs Pint to output units in abbreviated form. &nbsp;the P command adds formatting.&nbsp;</div>
