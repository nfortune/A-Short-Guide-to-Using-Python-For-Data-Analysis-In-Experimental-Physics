<div> You can view the complete notebook by clicking on the &lt;/&gt; Code button to the left of Fig.<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{234253}</span>&nbsp; below, then clicking on the file named&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://data.authorea.com:33014/notebooks/PintTest.ipynb" target="_blank">PintTest.ipynb</a> . Doing so will open up the notebook in Jupyter webserver hosted by Authorea. &nbsp;In some cases, Python notebooks such as these can be  run and modified within the webserver. In this case, however, you must first download the code to your own computer, as Pint is not yet included in the  Authorea's python installation.&nbsp; Note: the ~ command instructs Pint to output units in abbreviated form. The P command adds subscript and superscript formatting.&nbsp;</div>
