<div>The residuals are generally within one standard deviation of zero but do not appear randomly distributed. One possibility is that light beam, polarizers, and detector are not perfectly centered and the polarization is not completely uniform across the entire surface of the polarizer, resulting in  a weak residual angular dependence.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="871337" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h3 data-label="871337" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">chi-square test</h3><div></div><div>The calculation of the chi-square value used in determination of goodness of fit is also relatively straightforward.
