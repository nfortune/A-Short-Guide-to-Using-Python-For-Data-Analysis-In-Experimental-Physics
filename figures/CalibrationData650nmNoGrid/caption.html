<div data-label="780306">Photodiode voltage as a function of relative polarizer angle for light at 650 nm passing through two polarizers.&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_{pd}\)</span> corresponds to the voltage measured across a resistor placed in series with a photodiode and is linearly proportional to light intensity under these conditions. A change in polarization angle of the light (due to the Faraday effect, for example) can be detected as a change in photodiode voltage. The greate</div>
