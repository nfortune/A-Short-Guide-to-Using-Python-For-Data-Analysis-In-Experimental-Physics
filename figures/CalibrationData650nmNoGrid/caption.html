<div data-label="780306">Photodiode voltage as a function of relative polarizer angle for light at 650 nm passing through two polarizers.&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_{pd}\)</span> corresponds to the voltage measured across a resistor placed in series with a photodiode and is linearly proportional to light intensity. A change in polarization angle can therefore be detected as a change in photodiode voltage.&nbsp;</div>
