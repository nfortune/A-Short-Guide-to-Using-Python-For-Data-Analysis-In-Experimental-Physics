<div data-label="676696">residual error compared with estimated measurement uncertainty for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\pm\sigma\)</span> (in red) and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\pm2\sigma\)</span> (in orange).&nbsp; Most points are within one or two standard deviations of zero residual error, as expected for a good fit to the data using , but the points do not appear randomly distributed. Instead,  there is a weak  angular dependence suggesting a small uncorrected systematic misalignment of the light source and/or polarizers with respect to the detector. </div>
