<div data-label="525200">Photodiode voltage as a function of relative polarizer angle for light at 650 nm passing through two polarizers.&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_{pd}\)</span> corresponds to the voltage measured across a resistor placed in series with a photodiode and is linearly proportional to light intensity under these conditions. A change in polarization angle of the light (due to the Faraday effect, for example) can be detected as a change in photodiode voltage but the size of the change in voltage for a given change in polarization depends on the relative orientation of the two polarizers.&nbsp; The greatest sensitivity of the photodiode to changes in polarization angle occurs when the relative angle between the two polarizers is 45 degrees. </div>
