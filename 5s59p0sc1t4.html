<div>An example of data smoothing using the Savitzky-Golay low pass filter is shown in Fig&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{987576}</span>. Since for real experimental data the original 'clean signal' is unknown, the degree of smoothing is a matter of judgement. A comparison of several different smoothing values (not shown) can be useful in discerning the best choice of parameters and the effective resolution of your processed data (and any derivatives) .&nbsp;</div><div> </div>
