<div>An example of data smoothing using the Savitzky-Golay low pass filter is shown in Fig&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{987576}</span>. Significantly Increasing the window width increases the degree of smoothing, causing small features in the original 'clean signal' to disappear; significantly decreasing the window width decreasing the degree of smoothing, causing artificial features (arising from the noise) to emerge. Since for real experimental data the original 'clean signal' is unknown, the degree of smoothing is a matter of judgement! A comparithe values used for the smoothing parameters  when discerning the resolution of your experiment!&nbsp;</div>
