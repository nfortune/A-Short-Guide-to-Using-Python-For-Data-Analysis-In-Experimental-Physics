<div>An example of data smoothing using the Savitzky-Golay low pass filter is shown in Fig&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{987576}</span>. Significantly Increasing the window width increases the degree of smoothing, causing small features in the original 'clean signal' to disappear; significantly decreasing the window width decreasing the degree of smoothing, causing artificial features (arising from the noise) to emerge. Increasing the order of the polynomial decreases the noise reduction but is needed for if there is significant data curvature over the width of the smoothing window. Since for real experimental data the original 'clean signal' is unknown, the degree of smoothing is a matter of judgement! A comparison of several different smoothing values (not shown) can be useful in discerning the effective resolution of your processed data (and any derivatives) and&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
