<div>This method is used,&nbsp; for example,&nbsp; in the highly recommended Python-based textbook&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics</a> by Mark Newman&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{mark2013}</cite>.&nbsp; Here is another example:</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>To  import all numpy modules at once instead of one at a type as needed, type&nbsp;<code>from numpy import *</code>. The&nbsp;<code>import *</code> command is&nbsp; dangerously&nbsp;  convenient — we will sometimes use it ourselves, being not as pure in thought as others might be on this issue— but take two considerations in mind: (1) you are importing code you don't  need&nbsp; in addition to that you do, and (2)  if you have any already defined&nbsp; functions that have the same name as a numpy function, those functions will be overwritten.&nbsp; This is particularly prone to happen with mathematical functions. For example, the math package&nbsp;<code>math</code>, the complex mathematics package&nbsp;<code>cmath</code>, the numerical python package&nbsp;<code>numpy</code>, and the numerical calculation of uncertainties package&nbsp;<code>uncertainties</code> all have trigonometric functions called&nbsp;<code>sin</code> and&nbsp;<code>cos</code>!&nbsp; If you only need the sine&nbsp; and cosine functions from the numerical python package numpy but , typing from numpy import sin, cos &nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The&nbsp;<u>second method</u> requires a prefix before each use of a module. We call this the&nbsp;<b>traditional numpy import style</b>.&nbsp;</div>
