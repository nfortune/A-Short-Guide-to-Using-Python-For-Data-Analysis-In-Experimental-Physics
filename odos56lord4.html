<div>This method is used,&nbsp; for example,&nbsp; in the Python-based textbook&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics</a> by Mark Newman.&nbsp; This is, arguably, the simplest, easiest to understand method.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Note for Python geeks: If you wanted to import all modules from numpy at once, you coul type&nbsp;<code>from numpy import *</code> instead of&nbsp;<code>from numpy import loadtxt</code>. Although convenient, it does have some drawbacks: (1) you are importing code you don't  need (2) that additional code might include functions with the same name as one you are already using (which would overwrite your earlier definition). We don't recommend it unless you are using a lot of different numpy modules all at once. </div><div></div><div>The <u>second method</u> imports all numpy modules at once. We call this the <b>traditional numpy import style</b>. </div>
