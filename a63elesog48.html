In the SciPy implementation, this repeated fitting over a moving data stream  is done automatically for us.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>As noted above, the number of points included in the subset and the order of the polynomial must be&nbsp; specified by the user. In all data smoothing routines, there is a tradeoff between the degree of smoothing and the ability to resolve small features in the underlying signal; data smoothing is not a substitute for working as carefully as possible to minimize the measurement noise and maximize the accuracy and precision of the originally measured data! In the end, the&nbsp; 'best values' for these parameters are usually determined by trial and error. Keep track of the values used when determining the resolution of your experiment!&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="861207" class="ltx_title_subsection">Scipy.Signal.Savgol_filter</h2><div></div><div>This  filter can be&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.savgol_filter.html" target="_blank">implemented in Python</a> with just two lines of code: one to import from the&nbsp;<code>scipy.signal&nbsp;</code>module the function&nbsp; savgol_filter, </div><div></div><div>In the SciPy implementation&nbsp;<code>scipy.signal.savgol_filter</code> , we  need to specify two parameters:</div><div>&nbsp;</div><ol><li><i>window_length</i>,&nbsp; the number of adjacent data points we wish to include in the fit</li><li><i>polyorder</i>, the&nbsp;order of the polynomial fit (where 0 = constant, 1 = linear, 2 = quadratic, and 3 = cubic)</li></ol><div>If we also want to calculate the slope of the  data at each point by taking a derivative, we necessarily need to specify two additional  parameters :&nbsp;</div><div></div><ol><li>&nbsp;<i>deriv</i>, the&nbsp;order of the derivative (where 0 = no derivative, 1 = first derivative, 2 = 2nd derivative,...)</li><li><i>delta</i>, the&nbsp;spacing<b>&nbsp;</b>of the samples to which the filter will be applied.&nbsp;</li></ol><div> As an example, suppose we want again to determine&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\frac{dI}{dV}\)</span> from a measurement of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(I\left(V\right)\)</span> for applied voltages&nbsp; between -10 V and +30 V and that measurements were made evenly spaced in voltage with a step size of 0.1 V.
