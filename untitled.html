<h1 data-label="323300" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div></div><h2 data-label="796902" class="ltx_title_subsection">What this is</h2><div>This is a short guide to using Python to accomplish some commonly needed tasks when working with data acquired in an experimental physics lab, including data import/export, plotting with error bars, curve fitting of functions to data, testing the goodness of fit of these functions to the data (taking into account the uncertainty in the measurements), the interpolation, smoothing, and differentiation of data ,  the propagation of "error" in calculated quantities, and numerical calculations of data including units and/or uncertainty.  A careful discussion of how to import needed functions from the Numerical Python (numpy) and Scientific Python (SciPy) libraries — what Python calls 'packages' — is also included. I rely heavily on functions from these packages to simplify various analysis tasks in the examples below.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>My goal is for you to be carry out each of the analysis steps illustrated here using your own data, and to be able to do so by making at most only&nbsp; a few small changes (such as the names of data files and columns of data) to the templates included with each example. Beginners will need to know a few basic Python rules and syntax&nbsp; — for example, that&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(x^2\)</span> is written&nbsp;<code>x**2</code> and NOT as&nbsp;<code>x^2</code>— but will not need advanced programming skills to get started.&nbsp; Recommendations on how to get started with Python are included below. For more , I have  included a number of links to additional useful analysis tools and methods&nbsp;  Numpy and SciPy&nbsp; for more </div><div></div><h2 data-label="364433" class="ltx_title_subsection">What this is not</h2><div>If Python is new to you, I recommend starting by reading the very well written chapter&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/chapters/programming.pdf" target="_blank">Python programming for 	    physicists</a> from the  Python-based textbook&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics</a> by Mark Newman,&nbsp; which gives "an introduction to 	    the Python language at a level suitable for readers with no 	    previous programming experience"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{mark2013}</cite>.&nbsp; Instead of using the IDLE command line editor discussed in that textbook, however, we will run Python within the more user friendly  Mathematica-style&nbsp; Jupyter notebook interface. All the Python examples given in the text can also be used within the interactive Jupyter notebook. &nbsp; </div><div></div><div>If the Jupyter notebook (formerly iPython notebook) interface is new to you, please try out the very short but exceptionally helpful&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/binder/Index.ipynb" target="_blank"> online interactive&nbsp; tutorial</a> on how to run Python inside Jupyter  notebooks. The most important sections are the first two:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb" target="_blank">Notebook Basics</a> and<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/examples/IPython%20Kernel/Beyond%20Plain%20Python.ipynb" target="_blank"> iPython: beyond plain Python</a>. If you then want to add text and equations to Jupyter notebooks, see the third section (on&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.ipynb" target="_blank">Markdown Cells</a>). </div><div></div><div>&nbsp;<b>To try out the&nbsp; Python code used to generate the figures included in this guide</b>, click on the&nbsp;<code>&lt;/&gt; Code</code> button to the left of a&nbsp;figure to reveal the corresponding&nbsp;<code>.ipynb</code> Jupyter notebook and associated data files. Clicking on the notebook file name&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/9932/articles/11070-how-to-insert-jupyter-and-ipython-notebooks-in-authorea-articles" target="_blank">will launch the notebook within a Jupyter web server hosted by Authorea</a>. The notebook can then be run as usual. As with a Mathematica style notebook, clicking on a 'cell' and hitting SHIFT-ENTER will execute the cell and advance to the next one.&nbsp; Alternatively, make modifications to the notebook (for example, adjust a smoothing parameter) then Select&nbsp;<code>Run All</code> from the&nbsp;<code>Cell</code> Menu or&nbsp;<code>Restart &amp; Run All</code> from the&nbsp;<code>Kernel</code> Menu.&nbsp; For additional help, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/binder/Index.ipynb" target="_blank"> online interactive&nbsp; tutorial</a> on how to run Python inside Jupyter (formerly iPython) notebooks.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>Navigation Tip</b>: For a handy table of contents, select&nbsp;<b>Table of Contents</b> from the&nbsp;<b>Document</b> ▾ pull down menu (upper left of this page).&nbsp;  Clicking on an item in the  table of contents will take you to that section.&nbsp;</div>
