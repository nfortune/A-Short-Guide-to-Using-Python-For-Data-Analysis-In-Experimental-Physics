<div>This is a short guide to using Python to accomplish some commonly needed tasks when working with data acquired in lab, including data import, plotting, curve fitting, and  algebraic calculations (including units and uncertainties) . The examples involve student data collected in our advanced lab course&nbsp;<b>PHY350 Experimental Physics</b>. &nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="225119" class="ltx_title_section">Importing and exporting data</h1><div>There are many ways to import, export, and represent data in files. Here we provide just enough to get you started but it might be all you need. In these examples, we assume you first enter the data into a spreadsheet program (such as Microsoft Excel), then export that data in 'CSV' (comma separated variable) file format. This is a plain text file with commas marking where one value ends and another begins. </div><div></div><h2 data-label="313963" class="ltx_title_subsection">CSV spreadsheet  file format</h2><div></div><div>Let's assume that the data values were  entered in a spreadsheet consisting of one or more columns — one for each measured variable — and a few initial 'header' rows of text providing information about the data that we need to skip over when loading  numerical values. </div><div></div><div>Here's what the first few lines of &nbsp; what a&nbsp; typical  CSV spreadsheet file&nbsp;look like when openedtext file (in TextEdit or Notepad, for example):&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><div>analyzer angle,voltage (mV),dV (mV)</div><div>0,32.3625,0.014</div><div>15,30.0808,0.2</div><div>30,24.0285,0.3</div><div>45,15.8815,0.3</div></blockquote><div></div><div>Table&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{177785}</span> shows what the data in the same&nbsp; file looks like when viewed in&nbsp; spreadsheet form.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
