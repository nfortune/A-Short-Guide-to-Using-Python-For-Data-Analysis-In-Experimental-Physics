<div><b>This is a short guide to using Python to accomplish some commonly needed tasks when working with data acquired in an experimental physics lab</b>, including data import/export, plotting with error bars, curve fitting of functions to data, and  useful algebraic calculations involving units and uncertainties . Many of the examples make use of student data collected in our advanced lab course&nbsp;PHY350<i> Experimental Physics</i>.&nbsp; </div><div></div><div>The goal of this guide is that by  following the examples and modifying the attached sample Python code, you should be able to get up and running without first knowing how to accomplish advanced programming tasks (or even knowing how to write a for loop). To go further, however, you will need to learn some basic Python syntax (so as to be able to define your own mathematical functions for curve fitting, for example).&nbsp; </div><div></div><div>To get started, I recommend reading the very well written chapter&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/chapters/programming.pdf" target="_blank">Python programming for 	    physicists</a> from the  Python-based textbook&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics</a>, which gives "an introduction to 	    the Python language at a level suitable for readers with no 	    previous programming experience"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{mark2013}</cite>.&nbsp; Instead of the IDLE command line editor discussed there, however, we will run Python within the more user friendly  Mathematica-style&nbsp; Jupyter notebook interface. If this is new to you, see the short (and helpful)&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/binder/Index.ipynb" target="_blank"> online interactive&nbsp; tutorial</a> on how to run Python inside Jupyter  notebooks. The most important sections are&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb" target="_blank">Notebook Basics</a> and iPython: beyond plain P</div><div></div><div> highly recommended Python-based textbook&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics</a> by Mark Newman&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{mark2013}</cite>.&nbsp;knowing&nbsp; The goal of this guide is for you to be able to use Python for commonly used tasks,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>&nbsp;<b>To try out the&nbsp; Python code used to generate the figures included in this guide</b>, click on the&nbsp;<code>&lt;/&gt; Code</code> button to the left of a&nbsp;figure to reveal the corresponding&nbsp;<code>.ipynb</code> Jupyter notebook and associated data files. Clicking on the notebook file name&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/9932/articles/11070-how-to-insert-jupyter-and-ipython-notebooks-in-authorea-articles" target="_blank">will launch the notebook within a Jupyter web server hosted by Authorea</a>. The notebook can then be run as usual. As with a Mathematica style notebook, clicking on a 'cell' and hitting SHIFT-ENTER will execute the cell and advance to the next one.&nbsp; Alternatively, make modifications to the notebook (for example, adjust a smoothing parameter) then Select&nbsp;<code>Run All</code> from the&nbsp;<code>Cell</code> Menu or&nbsp;<code>Restart &amp; Run All</code> from the&nbsp;<code>Kernel</code> Menu.&nbsp; For additional help, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/binder/Index.ipynb" target="_blank"> online interactive&nbsp; tutorial</a> on how to run Python inside Jupyter (formerly iPython) notebooks.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>Navigation Tip</b>: For a handy table of contents, select&nbsp;<b>Table of Contents</b> from the&nbsp;<b>Document</b> â–¾ pull down menu (upper left of this page).&nbsp;  Clicking on an item in the  table of contents will take you to that section.&nbsp;</div>
