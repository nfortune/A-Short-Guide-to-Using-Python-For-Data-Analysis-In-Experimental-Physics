<div>This is a short guide to using Python as an advanced scientific calculator for data import, plotting, curve fitting, and simple algebraic calculations (including units and uncertainties) , as used in our advanced lab course PHY350 Experimental Physics. &nbsp;It is not intended as a complete &nbsp;introduction to scientific programming in Python but instead as a quick start guide to accomplishing some commonly needed tasks when working with data acquired in lab.&nbsp; </div><div></div><h1 data-label="225119" class="ltx_title_section">Importing and exporting data</h1><div>There are many ways to import, export, and represent data in files. Here we provide just enough to get you started but it might be all you need. In these examples, we assume you first enter the data into a spreadsheet program (such as Microsoft Excel), then export that data in 'CSV' (comma separated variable) file format. This is a plain text file with commas marking where one value ends and another begins. </div><div></div><h2 data-label="313963" class="ltx_title_subsection">CSV spreadsheet  file format</h2><div></div><div>For specificity, let's assume that the data values were  entered in a spreadsheet consisting of one or more columns — one for each measured variable — and a few initial 'header' rows of text providing information about the data that we need to skip over when loading  numerical values. Here's what the first few lines of a typical  spreadsheet might look like if opened as a text file&nbsp; </div><div></div><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><div>analyzer angle,voltage (mV),dV (mV)</div><div>0,32.3625,0.014</div><div>15,30.0808,0.2</div><div>30,24.0285,0.3</div><div>45,15.8815,0.3</div></blockquote><div></div><div>Table&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{177785}</span> shows what the data in the same&nbsp; file looks like when viewed in&nbsp; spreadsheet form.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
