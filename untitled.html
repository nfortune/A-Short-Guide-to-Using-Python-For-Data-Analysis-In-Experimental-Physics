A careful discussion of how to import needed functions from the Numerical Python (numpy) and Scientific Python (SciPy) libraries — what Python calls 'packages' — is also included. The examples presented here rely heavily on functions from these packages to simplify various analysis tasks in the examples below.&nbsp;The focus here is on using Python as a scientific and graphing calculator for experimental data, but more experienced Python users should still find the functions and methods presented here useful for their&nbsp; own programming tasks.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The goal of this guide is for you to be carry out each of the analysis steps illustrated here using your own data, and to be able to do so by making at most only&nbsp; a few small changes (such as the names of data files and columns of data) to the templates included with each example. Beginners will need to know a few basic Python rules and syntax&nbsp; — for example, that&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(x^2\)</span> is written&nbsp;<code>x**2</code> and NOT as&nbsp;<code>x^2</code>— but will not need to already be experienced programmers.&nbsp;   Recommendations on how to get started with Python are included below.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="364433" class="ltx_title_subsection">How to get started</h2><div></div><h3 data-label="159380" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Python</h3><div>If Python is new to you, we recommend starting by reading the very well written chapter&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/chapters/programming.pdf" target="_blank">Python programming for 	    physicists</a> from the  Python-based textbook&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics</a> by Mark Newman,&nbsp; which gives "an introduction to 	    the Python language at a level suitable for readers with no 	    previous programming experience"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{mark2013}</cite>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><h3 data-label="875394" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Jupyter Notebooks</h3><div>The examples provided in this guide&nbsp; run Python within   user friendly but somewhat oddly named  &nbsp;<a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tryjupyter.html" target="_blank">Jupyter&nbsp;</a>notebooks. In some ways they look and act like Mathematica® notebooks, including the use of 'cells' (paragraphs of text, equations, or code) and the use of the&nbsp;<code>shift+enter</code> keys&nbsp; to execute the code in a cell. Jupyter notebooks are a spin-off of what is known as&nbsp; interactive Python (iPython) and in older examples on the web, you will still encounter references to iPython Notebook instead of Jupyter. This is also why Jupyter is spelled as it is (with a 'py') and&nbsp; why  Jupyter notebook filenames end with&nbsp;<code>.ipynb</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>If the Jupyter notebook (formerly iPython notebook) interface is new to you,&nbsp; take time now to try the&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/binder/Index.ipynb" target="_blank"> online interactive&nbsp; tutorial</a> on how to run Python inside Jupyter  notebooks.&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/binder/Index.ipynb" target="_blank">Go ahead</a>, we'll wait. The most important web pages in that tutorial are the first two:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb" target="_blank">Notebook Basics</a> and<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/examples/IPython%20Kernel/Beyond%20Plain%20Python.ipynb" target="_blank"> iPython: beyond plain Python</a>. Once you are ready to learn how to add your own text and equations to Jupyter notebooks, see the third page (on&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.ipynb" target="_blank">Markdown Cells</a>).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div> Finally, note that Jupyter notebooks are not the only way to write and run Python code — a bare-bones  command line editor called IDLE is used by many beginning computer science students (and in the text&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics</a>) and&nbsp; a MATLAB® style interface called&nbsp;<a href="https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/" target="_blank">Spyder</a> (again with the 'py'!)  is used by many advanced Python programmers&nbsp;— and the&nbsp; Python examples provided here will run in any of these environments.&nbsp; But this also means you can run  the Python examples encour&nbsp; within your own Jupyter notebooks!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><h3 data-label="890878" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Try it out!&nbsp;</h3><div></div><div><i>On a webserver</i></div><div></div><div>Jupyter notebooks are viewed and run&nbsp; using a web browser such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> (just like this article in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/" target="_blank">Authorea</a>). That means they can also be run on a webserver that you access from a web browser and, as a result, it isn't necessary to have Python installed on your own computer (provided you have internet access and all the Python packages you wish to use are already installed on the webserver).&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div></div><div>To try out the&nbsp; Python programs presented here&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/9932/articles/11070-how-to-insert-jupyter-and-ipython-notebooks-in-authorea-articles" target="_blank">using a Jupyter webserver hosted by Authorea</a>, click the&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>&lt;/&gt; Code</code> button found to the left of many of the figures in this guide. This will reveal the &nbsp;<code>.ipynb</code> Jupyter notebook (and associated data files) containing the Python code used to generate that figure. Clicking on the notebook file name will launch the notebook in a new tab or window within your web browser . Clicking within  a 'cell' (a block of text, equations, and or code, outlined by a rectangular border) and hitting SHIFT-ENTER will run any code in that cell and advance to the next one.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can make edits to the code in notebook (for example, adjust a smoothing parameter or change the name of a file) then select&nbsp;<code>Run All</code> from the&nbsp;<code>Cell</code> menu or&nbsp;<code>Restart &amp; Run All</code> from the&nbsp;<code>Kernel</code> menu to rerun the program.&nbsp; For additional help, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/binder/Index.ipynb" target="_blank"> online interactive&nbsp; tutorial</a> on how to run Python inside Jupyter  notebooks.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Many schools&nbsp;<i>host and configure their own Jupyter webservers</i> for Python programming by their students. For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smith.edu/physics/" target="_blank">Smith College physics students</a> can upload and run any of the Jupyter notebooks included in this guide on the webserver&nbsp;<a href="https://jove.smith.edu">https://jove.smith.edu</a>, as&nbsp; this particular webserver has all the  packages used here preinstalled. (Note to Smith students: the https is required. Contact the course instructor for an account).&nbsp;</div>
