<div>This is a short guide to using Python as an advanced scientific calculator for data import, plotting, curve fitting, and simple algebraic calculations (including units and uncertainties) , as&nbsp; needed in our advanced lab course PHY350 Experimental Physics. &nbsp;It is not intended as a complete &nbsp;introduction to scientific programming in Python but instead as a quick start guide to accomplishing commonly needed tasks when working with data. Please take it as a slowly evolving work in progress: comments and suggestions are welcome but may take time to be incorporated! &nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="780221" class="ltx_title_section">Installing Python&nbsp;</h1><div></div><h2 data-label="896760" class="ltx_title_subsection">Using the Anaconda Navigator default installer</h2><div></div><div>text to be added</div><h2 data-label="896760" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="896760" class="ltx_title_subsection">Using other installers within Anaconda Navigator</h2><div></div><div>When needed, it is still &nbsp;relatively easy to use Anaconda Navigator to install packages not included in the standard &nbsp;Anaconda Navigator installer package. &nbsp;This screenshot shows how to open a&nbsp;<b>terminal window</b> from with Anaconda Navigator, then use the&nbsp;<b>pip installer</b>&nbsp;to install the Python package&nbsp;<a href="http://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html" target="_blank">Pint</a> using the following terminal window command:&nbsp;</div>
