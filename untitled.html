<div>This is a short guide to using Python to accomplish some commonly needed tasks when working with data acquired in lab, including data import/export, plotting with error bars, curve fitting of functions to data, and  useful algebraic calculations involving units and uncertainties . Many of the examples make use of student data collected in our advanced lab course&nbsp;PHY350<i> Experimental Physics</i>. &nbsp;</div><div></div><div>For a handy table of contents, select&nbsp;<b>Table of Contents</b> from the&nbsp;<b>Document</b> â–¾ pull down menu (upper left of this page).&nbsp; To try out the&nbsp; Python code used to generate the figures included in this guide, click on the &lt;/&gt; Code buttons to the left of a&nbsp; figure to reveal the corresponding .ipynb Jupyter notebook and associated data files. Clicking on the notebook file will launch the notebook within a Jupyter web server hosted by Authorea. The notebook can then be run as usual.

Here we provide just enough to get you started but it might very well be all you need.</div><div></div><div>In these examples, we assume you have first entered the data into a spreadsheet program, then exported that data in 'CSV' (comma separated variable) file format. We use the CSV file format here because it is ubiquitous: all spreadsheets have the ability to export and import data in the CSV file format. Data in other common plain text file formats (such as tab delimited) can also be imported by making a few small modifications to the examples provided below.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h2 data-label="313963" class="ltx_title_subsection">CSV spreadsheet  file format</h2><div></div><div>Let's look at a particular CSV data file titled&nbsp;<code>Calibration_650nm.csv</code> . The file consists of a single header row of text which we need to skip over when loading the numerical data, followed by three columns of data, one for each measured variable. </div><div></div><div>Here's what the data looks like in spreadsheet form (grid lines not shown):</div><div></div>
