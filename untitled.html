<h1 data-label="323300" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div></div><h2 data-label="796902" class="ltx_title_subsection">What this is</h2><div>This is a short guide to using Python to accomplish some commonly needed tasks when working with data acquired in an experimental physics lab, including data import/export, plotting with error bars, curve fitting of functions to data, testing the goodness of fit of these functions to the data (taking into account the uncertainty in the measurements), the interpolation, smoothing, and differentiation of data ,  the propagation of "error" in calculated quantities, and numerical calculations of data including units and/or uncertainty.  A careful discussion of how to import needed functions from the Numerical Python (numpy) and Scientific Python (SciPy) libraries — what Python calls 'packages' — is also included. I rely heavily on functions from these packages to simplify various analysis tasks in the examples below.&nbsp;The focus here is on using Python as a scientific and graphing calculator for experimental data, but more experienced Python users should still find the functions and methods presented here useful for their&nbsp; own programming tasks.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>My goal is for you to be carry out each of the analysis steps illustrated here using your own data, and to be able to do so by making at most only&nbsp; a few small changes (such as the names of data files and columns of data) to the templates included with each example. Beginners will need to know a few basic Python rules and syntax&nbsp; — for example, that&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(x^2\)</span> is written&nbsp;<code>x**2</code> and NOT as&nbsp;<code>x^2</code>— but will not need advanced programming skills.  Recommendations on how to get started with Python are included below.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="364433" class="ltx_title_subsection">How to get started</h2><div></div><h3 data-label="159380" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Python</h3><div>If Python is new to you, I recommend starting by reading the very well written chapter&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/chapters/programming.pdf" target="_blank">Python programming for 	    physicists</a> from the  Python-based textbook&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics</a> by Mark Newman,&nbsp; which gives "an introduction to 	    the Python language at a level suitable for readers with no 	    previous programming experience"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{mark2013}</cite>.&nbsp; </div><div></div><h3 data-label="875394" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Jupyter Notebooks</h3><div>The examples provided in this guide&nbsp; run Python within   user friendly but somewhat oddly named  &nbsp;<a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tryjupyter.html" target="_blank">Jupyter&nbsp;</a>notebooks. In some ways they look and act like Mathematica® notebooks, including the use of 'cells' (paragraphs of text, equations, or code) and the use of the&nbsp;<code>shift+enter</code> keys&nbsp; to execute the code in a cell. Jupyter notebooks are a spin-off of what is known as&nbsp; interactive Python (iPython) and in older examples on the web, you will still encounter references to iPython Notebook instead of Jupyter. This is also why Jupyter is spelled as it is (with a 'py') and&nbsp; why  Jupyter notebook filenames end with&nbsp;<code>.ipynb</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>If the Jupyter notebook (formerly iPython notebook) interface is new to you, please try out the very short but exceptionally helpful&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/binder/Index.ipynb" target="_blank"> online interactive&nbsp; tutorial</a> on how to run Python inside Jupyter  notebooks. The most important sections are the first two:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb" target="_blank">Notebook Basics</a> and<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/examples/IPython%20Kernel/Beyond%20Plain%20Python.ipynb" target="_blank"> iPython: beyond plain Python</a>. If you then want to add text and equations to Jupyter notebooks, see the third section (on&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.ipynb" target="_blank">Markdown Cells</a>). </div><div></div><div> Finally, note that Jupyter notebooks are not the only way to write and run Python code — the examples provided in the text&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics</a> use a  much more bare-bones  IDLE command line editor (familiar to many beginning computer science students) and advanced Python programmers&nbsp; often prefer a MATLAB® style interface such as Spyder (again with the 'py') that combines an editor for writing Python programs (ending in .py) with an interactive Python command line — and the&nbsp; Python examples provided here will run in any of these environments.&nbsp; But this also means you can run the Python examples provided in&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics</a>&nbsp; or other guides to scientific programming in Python within Jupyter notebooks!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><h3 data-label="890878" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Jupyter Webservers</h3><div></div><div>&nbsp;<b>To try out the&nbsp; Python code used to generate the figures included in this guide</b><b>, </b>click on the&nbsp;<code>&lt;/&gt; Code</code> button to the left of a&nbsp;figure to reveal the corresponding&nbsp;<code>.ipynb</code> Jupyter notebook and associated data files. Clicking on the notebook file name&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/9932/articles/11070-how-to-insert-jupyter-and-ipython-notebooks-in-authorea-articles" target="_blank">will launch the notebook within a Jupyter web server hosted by Authorea</a>. The notebook can then be run as usual. As with a Mathematica style notebook, clicking on a 'cell' and hitting SHIFT-ENTER will execute the cell and advance to the next one.&nbsp; Alternatively, make modifications to the notebook (for example, adjust a smoothing parameter) then Select&nbsp;<code>Run All</code> from the&nbsp;<code>Cell</code> Menu or&nbsp;<code>Restart &amp; Run All</code> from the&nbsp;<code>Kernel</code> Menu.&nbsp; For additional help, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/binder/Index.ipynb" target="_blank"> online interactive&nbsp; tutorial</a> on how to run Python inside Jupyter (formerly iPython) notebooks.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>Navigation Tip</b>: For a handy table of contents, select&nbsp;<b>Table of Contents</b> from the&nbsp;<b>Document</b> ▾ pull down menu (upper left of this page).&nbsp;  Clicking on an item in the  table of contents will take you to that section.&nbsp;</div>
