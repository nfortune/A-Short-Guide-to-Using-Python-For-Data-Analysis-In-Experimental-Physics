<div>This is a short guide to using Python to accomplish some commonly needed tasks when working with data acquired in lab, including data import/export, plotting with error bars, curve fitting of functions to data, and  useful algebraic calculations involving units and uncertainties . Many of the examples make use of student data collected in our advanced lab course&nbsp;PHY350<i> Experimental Physics</i>. &nbsp;</div><div></div><div>For a handy table of contents, select <b>Table of Contents</b> from the <b>Document</b> â–¾ pull down menu (upper left of this page).&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="225119" class="ltx_title_section">Importing and exporting data</h1><div>There are many ways to import, export, and represent data in files. Here we provide just enough to get you started but it might be all you need. In these examples, we assume you first enter the data into a spreadsheet program (such as Microsoft Excel), then export that data in 'CSV' (comma separated variable) file format. This is a plain text file with commas marking where one value ends and another begins. We use the CSV file format here because it is ubiquitous and easy to export/import using spreadsheets. Data in other plain text file formats&nbsp;See the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html?highlight=loadtxt" target="_blank">numpy.loadtxt</a> manual page for details.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The csv file is the&nbsp;<code>Calibration_650nm.csv</code> file shown earlier in section&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{313963}</span>&nbsp; with array names &nbsp;<code>angle</code> &nbsp;<code>V_pd</code>, and&nbsp;<code>delta_V_pd</code> .&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
