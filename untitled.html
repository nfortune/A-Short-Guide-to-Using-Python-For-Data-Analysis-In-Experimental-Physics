<div>This is a short guide to using Python to accomplish some commonly needed tasks when working with data acquired in lab, including data import/export, plotting with error bars, curve fitting of functions to data, and  useful algebraic calculations involving units and uncertainties . Many of the examples make use of student data collected in our advanced lab course&nbsp;PHY350<i> Experimental Physics</i>. &nbsp;</div><div></div><div>For a handy table of contents, select <b>Table of Contents</b> from the <b>Document</b> ▾ pull down menu (upper left of this page).&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="225119" class="ltx_title_section">Importing and exporting data</h1><div>There are many ways to import, export, and represent data in files. Here we provide just enough to get you started but it might very well be all you need.</div><div></div><div>In these examples, we assume you have first entered the data into a spreadsheet program, then exported that data in 'CSV' (comma separated variable) file format. We use the CSV file format here because it is ubiquitous: all spreadsheets have the ability to export and import data in the CSV file format. Data in other common plain text file formats (such as tab delimited) can also be imported by making a few small modifications to the examples provided below.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h2 data-label="313963" class="ltx_title_subsection">CSV spreadsheet  file format</h2><div></div><div>Let's look at a particular CSV data file titled&nbsp;<code>Calibration_650nm.csv</code> . The file consists of a single header row of text which we need to skipassume that the data values were  entered in a spreadsheet consisting of one or more columns — one for each measured variable — and a few initial 'header' rows of text providing information about the data that we need to skip over when loading  numerical values. The data was then exported in CSV file format and given the name .&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Here's what the data looks like in spreadsheet form (grid lines not shown):</div><div></div>
