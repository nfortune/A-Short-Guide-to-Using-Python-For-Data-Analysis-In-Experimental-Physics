<div>This is a short guide to using Python to accomplish some commonly needed tasks when working with data acquired in lab, including data import/export, plotting with error bars, curve fitting of functions to data, and  useful algebraic calculations involving units and uncertainties . Many of the examples make use of student data collected in our advanced lab course&nbsp;PHY350<i> Experimental Physics</i>. &nbsp;</div><div></div><div> To try out the&nbsp; Python code used to generate the figures included in this guide, click on the &lt;/&gt; Code buttons to the left of a&nbsp; figure to reveal the corresponding .ipynb Jupyter notebook and associated data files. Clicking on the notebook file will launch the notebook within a Jupyter web server hosted by Authorea. The notebook can then be run as usual. As with a Mathematica style notebook, clicking on a 'cell' and hitting SHIFT-ENTER will execute the cell and advance to the next one.&nbsp; Alternatively, make modifications to the notebook (for example, adjust a smoothing parameter) then Select&nbsp;<code>Run All</code> from the&nbsp;<code>Cell</code> Menu or&nbsp;<code>Restart &amp; Run All</code> from the&nbsp;<code>Kernel</code> Menu.&nbsp; For additional help, see the Autho</div><div></div><div>Navigation Tip: For a handy table of contents, select&nbsp;<b>Table of Contents</b> from the&nbsp;<b>Document</b> â–¾ pull down menu (upper left of this page).&nbsp;  Clicking on an item in the  table of contents will take you to that section.&nbsp;</div>
