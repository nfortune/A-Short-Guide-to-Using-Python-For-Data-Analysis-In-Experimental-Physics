<div>Now, however,  we encounter an apparent conundrum: the main point of the curve fit is to determine a best possible value for&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_0\)</span> (among other variables) but solving for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V\)</span> requires a numerical value for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_0\)</span>. How do we determine the numerical values for &nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V_{pd}\left(\theta\right)\)</span> needed&nbsp; to find a best estimate of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_0\)</span> if we don't already know&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_0\)</span>? This&nbsp; is not the impasse that it might seem because the curve fitting algorithm always requires that we  supply an initial guess for the parameters. In this situation,&nbsp; however, we   carry out the curve fitting algorithm repeatedly instead of just once, using the best fit values output by the algorithm as our new initial values. Once the output values match the input values, we stop. When the output values match the input values, we say the results are <i>self-consistent.&nbsp;</i></div>
