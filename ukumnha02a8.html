<div>If using the abbreviated prefix&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>np</code> instead of&nbsp;<code>numpy</code> doesn't make you swoon, you don't have to use it, but its usage is ubiquitous. To skip it, type <code>import numpy</code> instead of&nbsp;<code>import numpy as np</code>. In that case, you would then precede the&nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code> command with&nbsp;<code>numpy.</code>, as in&nbsp;<code>numpy.loadtxt</code>. If you preferred whimsy over clarity, you could try&nbsp;<code>import numpy as turtles</code>.&nbsp; Don't!&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>We call this the&nbsp;<b>traditional</b> method because this is what you will find in the examples included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/" target="_blank">official numpy user guide&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html" target="_blank">quickstart tutorials</a>.&nbsp; If you use this method, take note that you will&nbsp; have to specify that you are using a function&nbsp; or module from the numpy package each time you use that function by preceding it either with&nbsp;<code>numpy</code> or the abbreviation of your choice (such as&nbsp;<code>np</code>).&nbsp;  This is why the&nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code> command in this method is written&nbsp;<code>np.loadtxt</code> instead of&nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>In both cases, we  used the&nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code> command from Numerical Python (<code>numpy</code>) to load  the data from a .csv file.&nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code> can also load other types of text files: see the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html?highlight=loadtxt" target="_blank">numpy.loadtxt</a> manual page for details.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Note for Python geeks: if you are reading this, you probably know that if you use the direct method to type&nbsp;<code>from numpy import *</code> then&nbsp; you can import all numpy commands at once instead of one at a time&nbsp; .This&nbsp;<code>import *</code> approach is  convenient — we will sometimes do it ourselves, being not as pure in thought as others might be on this issue— but take two considerations in mind: (1) you are importing code you don't  need (2) you will overwrite an functions with the same name as a numpy function with the numpy version. &nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="971092" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="990368" class="ltx_title_subsection">saving  data to a CSV file</h2><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We now show a relatively simple method of using the&nbsp;<code>savetxt</code>  command from Numerical Python (numpy) to save the (<code>angle</code>,&nbsp;<code>V_pd</code>) data in csv format. It is almost as easy as the loadtxt command. There are many other methods out there. We prefer ours!&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Direct numpy import style:&nbsp;</div>
