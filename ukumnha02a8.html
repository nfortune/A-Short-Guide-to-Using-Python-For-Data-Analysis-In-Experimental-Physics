<div>This is the method you will find in examples wheIf you use this method, you will&nbsp; have to specify that you are using a function&nbsp; or module from the numpy package each time you use that function. To do so, you precede the name of the function with&nbsp;<code>np.</code>&nbsp;  This is why the loadtxt command in this method is written&nbsp;<code>np.loadtxt</code> instead of&nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code>.&nbsp; The use of the&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>np.</code>prefix helps identify when the numpy package is being used  but can become a  nuisance when writing your own code.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The choice of methods is yours, as long as you are consistent in your usage! </div><h2 data-label="971092" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="990368" class="ltx_title_subsection">saving multicolumn data to a spreadsheet file</h2><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We now show a relatively simple method of using the <code>savetxt</code>  command from Numerical Python (numpy) to save the (<code>angle</code>, <code>V_pd</code>, <code>V_pd_delta</code>) data in csv format.
