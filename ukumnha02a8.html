<div>We call this the <b>traditional</b> method because this is what you will find in the examples included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/" target="_blank">official numpy user guide&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html" target="_blank">quickstart tutorials</a>.&nbsp; If you use this method, take note that you will&nbsp; have to specify that you are using a function&nbsp; or module from the numpy package each time you use that function. To do so,  precede the name of the function with&nbsp;<code>np.</code>&nbsp;  This is why the loadtxt command in this method is written&nbsp;<code>np.loadtxt</code> instead of&nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code>.&nbsp; In examples, the use of the&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>np.</code>prefix helps identify when the numpy package is being used  but in your own code it can be a  nuisance to remember!&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The choice of methods is yours, as long as you are consistent in your usage. </div><div></div><div>Note for Python geeks: if you are reading this, you probably kto import all modules from numpy at once using the&nbsp;<b>direct</b> method,&nbsp;  type&nbsp;<code>from numpy import *</code> (in place of<code>from numpy import loadtxt</code>). Although a convenient and common practice, this import * approach has at least two drawbacks: (1) you are importing code you don't  need (2) that additional code might include functions with the same name as one you are already using (which would overwrite your earlier definition). Because it also imports all modules at once, the&nbsp;<b>traditional</b> method&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>import numpy as np</code> command has these same drawbacks.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="971092" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="990368" class="ltx_title_subsection">saving  data to a CSV file</h2><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We now show a relatively simple method of using the <code>savetxt</code>  command from Numerical Python (numpy) to save the (<code>angle</code>, <code>V_pd</code>, <code>V_pd_delta</code>) data in csv format.
