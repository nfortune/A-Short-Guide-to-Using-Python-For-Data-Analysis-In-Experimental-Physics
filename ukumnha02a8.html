<div>We call this the&nbsp;<b>traditional</b> method because this is what you will find in the examples included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/" target="_blank">official numpy user guide&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html" target="_blank">quickstart tutorials</a>.&nbsp; The key to this method is to be sure to specify that you are using a function&nbsp; or module from the numpy package each time you use that function by preceding it either with&nbsp;<code>numpy</code> or the abbreviation of your choice (such as&nbsp;<code>np</code>).&nbsp;  This is why the&nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code> command in this method is written&nbsp;<code>np.loadtxt</code> instead of&nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Here is a se</div><div></div><div>To  import all numpy modules at once instead of one at a type as needed, type&nbsp;<code>from numpy import *</code>. The&nbsp;<code>import *</code> command is&nbsp; dangerously&nbsp;  convenient — we will sometimes use it ourselves, being not as pure in thought as others might be on this issue— but take two considerations in mind: (1) you are importing code you don't  need&nbsp; in addition to that you do, and (2)  if you have any already defined&nbsp; functions that have the same name as a numpy function, those functions will be overwritten.&nbsp; This is particularly prone to happen with mathematical functions. For example, the math package&nbsp;<code>math</code>, the complex mathematics package&nbsp;<code>cmath</code>, the numerical python package&nbsp;<code>numpy</code>, and the numerical calculation of uncertainties package&nbsp;<code>uncertainties</code> all have trigonometric functions called&nbsp;<code>sin</code> and&nbsp;<code>cos</code>!&nbsp; If you only need the sine&nbsp; and cosine functions from the numerical python package numpy but , typing from numpy import sin, cos</div>
