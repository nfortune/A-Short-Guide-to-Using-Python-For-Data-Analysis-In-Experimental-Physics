<div>We call this the <b>traditional</b> method because this is what you will find in the examples included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/" target="_blank">official numpy user guide&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html" target="_blank">quickstart tutorials</a>.&nbsp; If you use this method, take note that you will&nbsp; have to specify that you are using a function&nbsp; or module from the numpy package each time you use that function. To do so,  precede the name of the function with&nbsp;<code>np.</code>&nbsp;  This is why the loadtxt command in this method is written&nbsp;<code>np.loadtxt</code> instead of&nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code>.&nbsp; The use of the&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>np.</code>prefix helps identify when the numpy package is being used  but can be a  nuisance to remember!&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Note for Python geeks: to import all modules from numpy at once using the&nbsp;<b>direct</b> method,&nbsp;  type&nbsp;<code>from numpy import *</code> (in place of<code>from numpy import loadtxt</code>). Although a convenient and common practice, this import * approach has at least two drawbacks: (1) you are importing code you don't  need (2) that additional code might include functions with the same name as one you are already using (which would overwrite your earlier definition). The <code>import numpy as np</code> command has these same drawbacks. </div>
