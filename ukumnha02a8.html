<div>This second method avoids having to name each specific numpy module you plan to use (by importing all of them!). The tradeoffs are (1) you are importing code you don't need (2) that additional code might include functions with the same name as one you are already using and (3) you ha specify that you are using a function&nbsp; or module from the numpy package each time you use it. Either method will do.  Pick one!&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="971092" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="990368" class="ltx_title_subsection">saving multicolumn data to a spreadsheet file</h2><div>&nbsp;</div><div>For completeness, we now show how to use the&nbsp;<code>savetxt</code>  command from Numerical Python (numpy) to save the (angle, V_pd, V_pd_delta) data in csv format.
