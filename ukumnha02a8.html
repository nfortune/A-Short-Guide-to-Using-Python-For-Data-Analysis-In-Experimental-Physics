<div>We call this the <b>traditional</b> method because this is what you will find in the examples included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/" target="_blank">official numpy user guide&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html" target="_blank">quickstart tutorials</a>.&nbsp; If you use this method, take note that you will&nbsp; have to specify that you are using a function&nbsp; or module from the numpy package each time you use that function. To do so,  precede the name of the function with&nbsp;<code>np.</code>&nbsp;  This is why the loadtxt command in this method is written&nbsp;<code>np.loadtxt</code> instead of&nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code>.&nbsp; In examples, the use of the&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>np.</code>prefix helps identify when the numpy package is being used  but in your own code it can be a  nuisance to remember!&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The choice of methods is yours, as long as you are consistent in your usage. </div><div></div><div>Note for Python geeks: if you are reading this, you probably know that there is also&nbsp; a way to import all modules from numpy at once using the&nbsp;<b>direct</b> method. To do this, you  type&nbsp;<code>from numpy import *</code> (in place of<code>from numpy import loadtxt</code>, etc.). This&nbsp;<code>import *</code> approach is very common and convenient but it has at least two drawbacks: (1) you are importing code you don't  need (2) you might inad functions with the same name as one you are already using (which would overwrite your earlier definition). The&nbsp;<b>traditional</b> method&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>import numpy as np</code> command has these same drawbacks, of course.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="971092" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="990368" class="ltx_title_subsection">saving  data to a CSV file</h2><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We now show a relatively simple method of using the <code>savetxt</code>  command from Numerical Python (numpy) to save the (<code>angle</code>, <code>V_pd</code>, <code>V_pd_delta</code>) data in csv format.
