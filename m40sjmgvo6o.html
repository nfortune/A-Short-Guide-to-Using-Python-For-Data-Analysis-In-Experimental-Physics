<div>As will be shown below, the true value of the InterpolatingUnivariateSpline method is in the ability to find derivatives and roots. Here we first construct a generating function for the 1st derivative of the original univariate spline, then use that to evaluate the derivative at the same points as before: </div><div></div><div></div>
