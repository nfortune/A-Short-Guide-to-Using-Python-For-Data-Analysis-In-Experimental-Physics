O. Lebigot. &nbsp;The uncertainties module returns its result with the uncertainty specified by linear&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty">error propagation theory</a>,  correctly taking into account any direct correlations between variables. &nbsp;This is in fact what Pint uses under the hood!&nbsp; </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>If you need still more advanced approaches to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty" target="_blank"> propagation of uncertainty</a>, Lebigot recommends trying &nbsp;<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/soerp">soerp</a>&nbsp;(second-order approximations) and&nbsp;<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mcerp">mcerp</a>&nbsp;(Monte-Carlo approach).&nbsp; I haven't yet done so. </div><div></div><h1 data-label="225119" class="ltx_title_section">Importing and exporting data from spreadsheet files</h1><div>There are many ways to import, export, and represent data in files. Here we provide just enough to get you started.&nbsp; </div><div></div><div>For specificity, let's assume that the data values were first entered in a spreadsheet consisting of one or more columns — one for each measured variable — and a few initial 'header' rows of text providing information about the data that we need to skip over when loading  numerical values, then n exported as a  text file. For specificity, we're going to assume the data was exported as a '.CSV' text file (where CSV stands for 'comma-separated-variables') but the Numerical Python (numpy) command we are going to use can also handle other types of simple text files as well (such as tab or space delimited).&nbsp; See the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html?highlight=loadtxt" target="_blank">numpy.loadtxt</a> manual page for details. </div><div></div><div>Table&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{177785}</span> shows what the data in the file&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>650 nm calibration with error.csv&nbsp;</code> looks like when viewed in&nbsp; spreadsheet form. To see what the data looks like&nbsp;<i>as a text file</i>, first click on the Data icon to the left of the table to reveal the data file, then instruct your web browser to open the file with a plain text editor  (instead of a spreadsheet program).&nbsp;</div><div></div>
