O. Lebigot. &nbsp;The uncertainties module returns its result with the uncertainty specified by linear&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty">error propagation theory</a>,  correctly taking into account any direct correlations between variables. &nbsp;This is in fact what Pint uses under the hood!&nbsp; </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>If you need still more advanced approaches to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty" target="_blank"> propagation of uncertainty</a>, Lebigot recommends trying &nbsp;<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/soerp">soerp</a>&nbsp;(second-order approximations) and&nbsp;<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mcerp">mcerp</a>&nbsp;(Monte-Carlo approach).&nbsp; I haven't yet done so. </div><div></div><h1 data-label="225119" class="ltx_title_section">Importing and exporting data from spreadsheet files</h1><div>There are many ways to import, export, and represent data in files. Here we provide just enough to get you started.&nbsp; To that purpose, let's assume that the data values were first entered in a spreadsheet consisting of one or more columns — one for each measured variable — and a few initial 'header' rows of text providing information about the data that we need to skip over when loading  numerical values. The data was then exported as a  text file. For specificity, we're going to assume the data was exported as a '.CSV' text file (where CSV stands for 'comma-separated-variables') but the Numerical Python (numpy) command we are going to use can also handle other types of simple text files as well (such as tab or space delimited).&nbsp; See the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html?highlight=loadtxt" target="_blank">numpy.loadtxt</a> manual page for details. </div><div></div><div>We will use the loadtxt command from Numerical Python (numpy) to load the data. Below are two ways of accomplishing the same task: loading data from a .csv text file with three columns of data (say x, y, and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta y\)</span> ) and one row of text  preceding the data.&nbsp; Each column of data becomes a Numerical Python array. In this example, the array names are <i>angle</i>, <i>V_pd</i>, and <i>V_pd_delta</i>. </div><div></div><div>This first method (used, for example,&nbsp; in the text Computational Physics by Mark Newman) imports&nbsp; individual functions&nbsp; and modules from numpy as needed. </div>
