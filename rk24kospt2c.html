<div>The&nbsp;<u>direct import method</u> has the advantage of being lean, clean, and easy to read. If you only ever need&nbsp; the numerical Python package numpy and a plotting package called matplotlib, this method will be the simplest. In our work, however, we will sometimes need to use multiple packages, some of which will have identically named functions.&nbsp; For example, the math package&nbsp;<code>math</code>, the complex mathematics package&nbsp;<code>cmath</code>, the numerical python package&nbsp;<code>numpy</code>, and the numerical calculation of uncertainties package&nbsp;<code>uncertainties</code> all have trigonometric functions called&nbsp;<code>sin</code> and&nbsp;<code>cos</code>.&nbsp; To keep it clear which function we are using from which package, therefore, we will use an alternative <u>traditional import method</u>.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>In this alternative <u>second method</u>, we import all of numpy, provide an abbreviation for numpy, then  use that&nbsp; before each use of the&nbsp; function imported from that package. We call this the&nbsp;<b>traditional  import style</b>.&nbsp;</div>
