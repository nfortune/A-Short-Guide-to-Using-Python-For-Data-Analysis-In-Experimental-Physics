<div>This first method has the advantage of being lean, clean, and easy to read. If you only ever need&nbsp; the numerical Python package numpy and a plotting package called matplotlib, this method will be the simplest. In our work, however, we will sometimes need to use multiple packages, some of which will have identically named functions.&nbsp; </div><div>In the&nbsp;<u>second method</u>, we import all of numpy, then  provide a prefix before each use of the&nbsp; function imported from that package. We call this the&nbsp;<b>traditional numpy import style</b>.&nbsp;</div>
