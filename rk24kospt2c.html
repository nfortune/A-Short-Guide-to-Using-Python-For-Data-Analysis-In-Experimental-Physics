<div>This first method has the advantage of being lean, clean, and easy to read. If you only ever need&nbsp; the numerical Python package numpy and a plotting package called matplotlib, this method will be the simplest. In our work, however, we will sometimes need to use multiple packages, some of which will have identically named functions.&nbsp; For example, the math package&nbsp;<code>math</code>, the complex mathematics package&nbsp;<code>cmath</code>, the numerical python package&nbsp;<code>numpy</code>, and the numerical calculation of uncertainties package&nbsp;<code>uncertainties</code> all have trigonometric functions called&nbsp;<code>sin</code> and&nbsp;<code>cos</code>.&nbsp; To keep it clear </div><div>In the&nbsp;<u>second method</u>, we import all of numpy, then  provide a prefix before each use of the&nbsp; function imported from that package. We call this the&nbsp;<b>traditional numpy import style</b>.&nbsp;</div>
