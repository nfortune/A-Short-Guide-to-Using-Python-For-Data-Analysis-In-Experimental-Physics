<div></div><div></div><div> Finally, note that Jupyter notebooks are not the only way to write and run Python code — the examples provided in the text&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics</a> use a  much more bare-bones  IDLE command line editor (familiar to many beginning computer science students) and advanced Python programmers&nbsp; often prefer a MATLAB® style interface such as Spyder (again with the 'py') that combines an editor for writing Python programs (ending in .py) with an interactive Python command line — and the&nbsp; Python examples provided here will run in any of these environments.&nbsp; But this also means you can run the Python examples provided in&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics</a>&nbsp; or other guides to scientific programming in Python within Jupyter notebooks!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><h3 data-label="890878" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Try it out! </h3><div></div><div><i>On a webserver</i></div><div></div><div>Jupyter notebooks are viewed and run&nbsp; using a web browser such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> (just like this article in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/" target="_blank">Authorea</a>). That means they can also be run on a webserver that you access from a web browser and, as a result, it isn't necessary to have Python installed on your own computer (provided you have internet access and all the Python packages you wish to use are already installed on the webserver).&nbsp;  </div><div></div><div>To try out the&nbsp; Python programs presented here&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/9932/articles/11070-how-to-insert-jupyter-and-ipython-notebooks-in-authorea-articles" target="_blank">using a Jupyter webserver hosted by Authorea</a>, click the&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>&lt;/&gt; Code</code> button found to the left of many of the figures in this guide. This will reveal the &nbsp;<code>.ipynb</code> Jupyter notebook (and associated data files) containing the Python code used to generate that figure. Clicking on the notebook file name will launch the notebook in a new tab or window within your web browser . The notebook can then be run as usual. This will work for all but the examples using the aptly named Python packages <a href="https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Pint</a> and <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/" target="_blank">Uncertainties</a> for numerical calculations using units and/or uncertainties, as those packages are not currently available on the Authorea Jupyter webserver (but maybe someday?). </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Many schools&nbsp;<i>host and configure their own Jupyter webservers</i> for Python programming by their students. For example, <a href="https://www.smith.edu/physics/" target="_blank">Smith College physics students</a> can upload and run any of the Jupyter notebooks included in this guide on the webserver&nbsp;<a href="https://jove.smith.edu">https://jove.smith.edu</a>, as&nbsp; this particular webserver has all the  packages used here preinstalled. (Note to Smith students: the https is required. Contact the course instructor for an account).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><i>On your own computer</i></div><div></div><div>If you are interested in installing and running Python on your own computer, see section <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{662059}</span> for instructions. </div><div></div><div><b>Navigation Tip</b>: For a handy table of contents, select&nbsp;<b>Table of Contents</b> from the&nbsp;<b>Document</b> ▾ pull down menu (upper left of this page).&nbsp;  Clicking on an item in the  table of contents will take you to that section.&nbsp;</div>
