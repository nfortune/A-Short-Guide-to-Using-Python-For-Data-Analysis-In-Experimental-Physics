<div>The Authorea server will work for all of the examples except the (aptly named) Python packages&nbsp;<a href="https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Pint</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/" target="_blank">Uncertainties</a> for numerical calculations using units and/or uncertainties, as those packages are not currently available on the Authorea server (but maybe someday?) but is not designed for hosting your own data and That said, the server is not particularly speedy and you will want to save your results somewhere else. If you don't have access to your own webserver (or it doesn't have the packages you need), you will want to install and run Python and Jupyter on your own computer. See section&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{662059}</span> for instructions.&nbsp;</div>
