<div>The Authorea server will work for all of the examples except the (aptly named) Python packages&nbsp;<a href="https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Pint</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/" target="_blank">Uncertainties</a> for numerical calculations using units and/or uncertainties, as those packages are not currently available on the Authorea server (but maybe someday?) but is not designed for hosting your own data and programs (unless you are writing an article about them?) nor is it particularly speedy.&nbsp;  If you don't have access to a local Jupyter webserver with the packages you need (or you prefer a different Python inter, you will want to install and run Python and Jupyter on your own computer. See section&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{662059}</span> for instructions.&nbsp;</div>
