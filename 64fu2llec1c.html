<div>Although not included in the standard installer package, it is still relatively easy to install using Anaconda Navigator using the 'pip install --upgrade pint' command from the terminal window. See documentation page for Pint and screenshot below for an example. &nbsp;An example of how to start up and use Pint is attached as code to the screenshot. You can view it by clicking on&nbsp;<a href="http://data.authorea.com:33014/notebooks/PintTest.ipynb" target="_blank">PintTest.ipynb</a>&nbsp;. Unlike most of the examples in this article, however,  it won't successfully run (at present) because Pint is not included on the standard install of Authorea's python webserver. &nbsp;This will be addressed in a future version.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div>
