<div>The&nbsp;direct import method has the advantage of being lean, clean, and easy to read. If you only ever need&nbsp; the numerical Python package numpy and a plotting package called matplotlib, this method will be the simplest. And computer scientistsIn our work, however, we will sometimes need to use multiple packages, some of which will have identically named functions.&nbsp; For example, the math package&nbsp;<code>math</code>, the complex mathematics package&nbsp;<code>cmath</code>, the numerical python package&nbsp;<code>numpy</code>, and the numerical calculation of uncertainties package&nbsp;<code>uncertainties</code> all have trigonometric functions called&nbsp;<code>sin</code> and&nbsp;<code>cos</code>.&nbsp; To keep it clear which function we are using from which package, therefore, we will usually use the&nbsp; traditional import style. </div>
