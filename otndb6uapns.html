<div>OnThe&nbsp;direct import method has the advantage of being lean, clean, and easy to read. Computer scientists love it. In our work, however, we will sometimes need to use multiple packages with identically named functions.&nbsp; For example, the math package&nbsp;<code>math</code>, the complex mathematics package&nbsp;<code>cmath</code>, the numerical python package&nbsp;<code>numpy</code>, and the numerical calculation of uncertainties package&nbsp;<code>uncertainties</code> all have trigonometric functions called&nbsp;<code>sin</code> and&nbsp;<code>cos</code>.&nbsp; To keep it clear which function we are using from which package, therefore, we will usually use the&nbsp; traditional import style. </div>
