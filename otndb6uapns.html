<div>One one hand, the&nbsp;direct import method has the advantage of being lean, clean, and easy to read. Computer scientists love it. </div><div>On the other hand, it does not work well if we need to use multiple packages containing identically named functions.&nbsp; For example, the math package&nbsp;<code>math</code>, the complex mathematics package&nbsp;<code>cmath</code>, the numerical python package&nbsp;<code>numpy</code>, and the numerical calculation of uncertainties package&nbsp;<code>uncertainties</code> all have trigonometric functions called&nbsp;<code>sin</code> and&nbsp;<code>cos</code>.&nbsp; To keep clear which function we are using from which package, and when, we will usually use the&nbsp; traditional import style. </div>
