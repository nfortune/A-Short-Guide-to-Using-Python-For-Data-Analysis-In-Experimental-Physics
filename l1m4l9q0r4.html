When used, these abilities &nbsp;offer the advantage of allowing us to check algebraic calculations, automatically propagate  uncertainties in calculated quantities, and avoid unit conversion errors, but the necessary Python modules are not included in the standard Anaconda Navigator Python installation and must be added by hand (unless already installed as part of a specially configured webserver).&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="655342" class="ltx_title_subsection">Calculations with units</h2><div></div><div>In the&nbsp; PHY350 Experimental Physics course here at Smith College, we make extensive use of the Python module &nbsp;<a href="http://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html" target="_blank">Pint</a>&nbsp;by Hernan Greco. </div><div>Here is an example of using Pint for calculations with units: &nbsp;</div>
