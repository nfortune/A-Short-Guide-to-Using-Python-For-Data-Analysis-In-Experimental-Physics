<div>Many schools&nbsp;<i>host and configure their own Jupyter webservers</i> for Python programming by their students. For example, <a href="https://www.smith.edu/physics/" target="_blank">Smith College physics students</a> can upload and run any of the Jupyter notebooks included in this guide on the webserver&nbsp;<a href="https://jove.smith.edu">https://jove.smith.edu</a>, as&nbsp; this particular webserver has all the  packages used here preinstalled. (Note to Smith students: the https is required. Contact the course instructor for an account).&nbsp;</div>
