<div>This  is not the impasse that it might seem, however, as we always need to  supply an initial guess for our curve-fit parameters and we can make a  rough first guess from a graph of the data itself. The solution is to  then take the values provided by the curve fit as the initial guesses  for a second round of curve fitting, and continue until the result is <b>self-consistent</b> (that is, the output value matches the input value within the reported uncertainty).&nbsp;</div>
