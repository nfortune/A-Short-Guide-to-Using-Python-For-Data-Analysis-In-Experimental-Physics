Practically speaking, this means the curve-fitting routine tries harder to match the model to the data at points with a smaller uncertainty.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Note: there are additional features of the curve_fit function not demonstrated here, including the ability to set lower and upper bounds on each of the adjustable parameters.
