<div>Overall, the model appears to describe the data well To answer this, we will evaluate the fit residuals and chi-square test goodness of fit. See section <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{304456}</span>. </div><div></div><div>Note that this was a "weighted" fit, in that the stated uncertainty of each data point was taken into account during the fit. Practically speaking, this means the curve-fitting routine tries harder to match the model to the data at points with a smaller uncertainty. This is an extra step you may not have taken before but it is essential to evaluating the 'goodness of fit' of this 'best fit' to the data, as discussed further below. </div><div></div><div>Note: there are additional features of the curve_fit function not demonstrated here, including the ability to set lower and upper bounds on each of the adjustable parameters. For example, including <code>bounds = ([0, -np.pi,&nbsp; -1.0], [np.inf, +np.pi, 1.0])</code></div><div>&nbsp;would require&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(0\ \le I_0\)</span> ,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-\pi\le\theta_0\ \le\pi\)</span> in rad, and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-1\ \le\text{offset}\ \le+1\)</span>.&nbsp; See the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html#scipy.optimize.curve_fit" target="_blank">scipy.optimize.curve_fit</a> documentation for details.&nbsp;</div><div> </div><h2 data-label="304456" class="ltx_title_subsection">goodness of fit</h2><div></div><div>We now have a best fit of the model to the data.
