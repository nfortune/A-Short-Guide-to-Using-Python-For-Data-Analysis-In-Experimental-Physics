Note that this was a "weighted" fit, in that the stated uncertainty of each data point was taken into account during the fit. Practically speaking, this means the curve-fitting routine tries harder to match the model to the data at points with a smaller uncertainty. This is an extra step you may not have taken before but it is essential to evaluag</div><div></div><div>Note: there are additional features of the curve_fit function not demonstrated here, including the ability to set lower and upper bounds on each of the adjustable parameters.
