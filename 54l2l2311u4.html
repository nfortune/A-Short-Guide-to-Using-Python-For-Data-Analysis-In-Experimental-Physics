<h1 data-label="662059" class="ltx_title_section">Installing Python Packages</h1><div></div><div>This section is only relevant if you are running Python on your own computer. If you are running Python within a Jupyter notebook on a webserver or a computer account which has already been configured for your use (such as&nbsp;<a href="https://jove.smith.edu">https://jove.smith.edu</a> for Smith College physics) , this section can be skipped.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Many of the Python commands in the code blocks included in this article can be run from the iPython command line, within a Jupyter notebook (which resembles a Mathematica-like notebook environment), or in Spyder (which resembles a MATLAB like environment) . The command line is convenient for quick calculations and tests of code but is inadequate for serious editing and debugging.&nbsp; In our Smith Physics courses, we use Jupyter notebooks both&nbsp; to run Python code&nbsp; and  to generate a "self-documenting" electronic lab notebook as we do so.   If you are doing a lot of programming requiring extensive re-writing and debugging, you may prefer a development environment like Spyder, but it is not needed for the examples provided here.&nbsp;</div>
