If you are running Python within a Jupyter notebook on a webserver or a computer account which has already been configured for your use (such as&nbsp;<a href="https://jove.smith.edu">https://jove.smith.edu</a> for Smith College physics) , this section can be skipped.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="734994" class="ltx_title_subsection">Installing  Anaconda Navigator</h2><div>Our focus in this article&nbsp; is on the use of Python to expedite the&nbsp; analysis of your experimental data and not, for example, the specifics of various Python distributions and their relative merits for computational physics in terms of speed, accuracy, and memory requirements.&nbsp; </div><div></div><div>We therefore recommend that you o install Python, interactive Python&nbsp; (iPython) and Jupyter notebooks,&nbsp; scientific python development environments (editing, testing, debugging)&nbsp; such as Spyder,&nbsp; and&nbsp; essential&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scipy.org" target="_blank">Scientific Python packages</a> such as numpy, matplotlib and scipy on your computer: a free  and comprehensive Python distribution and installer package&nbsp; called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" target="_blank">Anaconda Navigator</a>.&nbsp; This is freely available for Mac OS, Linux, and Windows.
