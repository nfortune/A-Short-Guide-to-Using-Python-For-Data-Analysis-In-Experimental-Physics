<h1 data-label="662059" class="ltx_title_section">Installing Python Packages</h1><div></div><div>This section is only relevant if you are running Python on your own computer. If you are running Python within a Jupyter notebook on a webserver or a computer account which has already been configured for your use (such as&nbsp;<a href="https://jove.smith.edu">https://jove.smith.edu</a> for Smith College physics) , this section can be skipped.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="734994" class="ltx_title_subsection">Installing  Anaconda Navigator</h2><div>Our focus in this article&nbsp; is on the use of Python to expedite the&nbsp; analysis of your experimental data and not, for example, the specifics of various Python distributions and their relative merits for computational physics in terms of speed, accuracy, and memory requirements.&nbsp; </div><div></div><div>We therefore recommend that if you need to install a Python distribution for scientific data analysis in physics on your own computer, you choose an installer that will automatically install Python, interactive Python&nbsp; (iPython) and Jupyter notebooks,&nbsp; scientific python development environments (editing, testing, debugging)&nbsp; such as&nbsp;<a href="https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/" target="_blank">Spyder</a> or Canopy,&nbsp; and&nbsp; essential&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scipy.org" target="_blank">Scientific Python packages</a> (such as numpy, matplotlib and scipy )in a single step, rather than building this from scratch. Two of the most popular distributions and installers are from&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" target="_blank">Anaconda&nbsp;</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/" target="_blank">Enthought</a>.&nbsp; Both are freely available for Mac OS, Linux, and Windows .&nbsp; Either should do what you need. That said,  the examples presented below for installation of additional Python packages assume the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" target="_blank">Anaconda Navigator</a>. </div><div></div><div>We recommend a comprehensive distribution and package managers like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" target="_blank">Anaconda Navigator</a> for their ease of installation,  ease of use,&nbsp; and comprehensive set of preinstalled and easily added packages.&nbsp; Others will prefer t a leaner&nbsp; Python installation</div><div></div><h2 data-label="140511" class="ltx_title_subsection">Using the Anaconda Navigator  installer</h2>
