<div>Packages included in the Anaconda Python distribution can be&nbsp; installed and updated using the Anaconda Navigator installer. This has an easy to use graphical interface. As a bonus, any needed auxiliary files will&nbsp; updated at the same time . Potential conflicts between packages will be identified ahead of time. See the section of the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/getting-started" target="_blank">Getting Starting guide</a> provided by Anaconda titled&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/getting-started#managing-packages" target="_blank">Managing Packages</a> for step by step instructions.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="273995" class="ltx_title_subsection">Using command line installers</h2><div>Packages not included in the standard &nbsp;Anaconda Navigator installer can still be installed using Anaconda Navigator.
