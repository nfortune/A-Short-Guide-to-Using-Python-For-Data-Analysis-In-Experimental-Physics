<div></div><div>Here we encounter an apparent conundrum: the main point of the curve fit is to determine &nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_0\)</span> but solving for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V\)</span> requires a numerical value for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_0\)</span>. How do we determine the numerical values for &nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V_{pd}\left(\theta\right)\)</span> needed&nbsp; to find a best estimate of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_0\)</span> if we don't already know&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_0\)</span>?</div><div></div><div>This, however,&nbsp;  is not the impasse that it might seem, as curve fitting always requires that we  supply an initial guess for the parameters and we can carry out the curve fitting algorithm more than once. Here then is the procedure for obtaining a self-consisent v our curve-fit parameters and we can make  a  rough first guess from a graph of the data itself. The solution is  to  then take the values provided by the curve fit as the initial  guesses  for a second round of curve fitting, and continue until the  result is&nbsp;<b>self-consistent</b> (that is, the output value matches the input value within the reported uncertainty).&nbsp;</div>
