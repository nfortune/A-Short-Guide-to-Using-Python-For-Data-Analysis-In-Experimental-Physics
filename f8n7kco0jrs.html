<div>Note:&nbsp; ordinarily,&nbsp;<code>savetxt</code>  would save the data  with each&nbsp;<i>variable</i> corresponding to a different&nbsp;<i>row</i> instead of to a different&nbsp;<i>column</i>.&nbsp; That is, the default is to save the data in 'unpacked' format. This is often convenient for work within python but is&nbsp;<i>not</i> what we wanted&nbsp; in this particular case.&nbsp; We therefore  did the following trick before saving the data to a file: we created a 2D matrix of our data with the command&nbsp;array([angle, V_pd, V_pd_delta]), then used the&nbsp;<b>.T</b><i>&nbsp;</i>command to transpose the matrix , thereby flipping the rows and columns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="344573" class="ltx_title_section">Plotting data using (optional) error bars</h1><div></div><div>The code attached to Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{780306}</span> below&nbsp; provides an example of how to&nbsp; import and plot data from a 'comma separated variable' (CSV) spreadsheet.
