<div>Here we show how to use&nbsp;<code>InterpolatedUnivariateSpline</code> to interpolate the same data as before using a 4th order spline, find a (3rd order) derivative, find the roots of that derivative, and then use that information to identify the extrema&nbsp; for the original interpolating spline.  For corresponding examples  using&nbsp;<code>UnivariateSpline</code>, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline.html#scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline" target="_blank">reference manual page</a>.</div><div></div><div>Let us assume we have imported the data as before and are now ready to interpolate the data. Interpolation is again a two-step process: construct an interpolating function, then apply it to generate new data values. </div><div></div><div></div>
