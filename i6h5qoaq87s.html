<div>Here we show how to use&nbsp;<code>InterpolatedUnivariateSpline</code> to fit the same data used previously with&nbsp;<code>interp1d</code>.&nbsp; For corresponding examples  using&nbsp;<code>UnivariateSpline</code>, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline.html#scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline" target="_blank">reference manual page</a>.</div><div></div><div>In this example, we will interpolate the data using a 4th order spline, find a (3rd order) derivative, find the roots of that 3rd order derivative, and use that information to identify the extr the original interpolating spline </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>&nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="822768" class="ltx_title_section">Working with units and uncertainties</h1><div></div><div>When using Python in place of a calculator, we have the ability to directly include information about dimensions, units and uncertainties in the calculations. When used, these abilities &nbsp;offer the advantage of allowing us to check algebraic calculations, automatically propagate  uncertainties in calculated quantities, and avoid unit conversion errors, but the necessary Python modules are not included in the standard Anaconda Navigator Python installation and must be added by hand if needed. (Note for Smith students:&nbsp;  these additional modules&nbsp; are already installed on  the Smith Physics Jupyter webserver&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://jove.smith.edu">https://jove.smith.edu</a> and the classroom computers for PHY 350)</div>
