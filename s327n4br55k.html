<div></div><div>For more extensive calculations without units, we use&nbsp;<a href="https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/" target="_blank">Uncertainties</a>, a &nbsp;free, cross-platform program that&nbsp;&nbsp;handles calculations with&nbsp;numbers with uncertainties&nbsp;(like 9.80Â±0.03). This is in fact what Pint uses under the hood. The uncertainties package returns its result with an uncertainty as predicted by linear&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty">error propagation theory</a>, while also correctly taking into account correlations between variables. &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>Lebigot recommends two related uncertainty calculation Python packages if you need still more advanced approaches to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty" target="_blank"> propagation of uncertainty</a>y but we have not tried them ourselves yet :&nbsp;<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/soerp">soerp</a>&nbsp;(second-order approximations) and&nbsp;<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mcerp">mcerp</a>&nbsp;(Monte-Carlo approach).</div>
