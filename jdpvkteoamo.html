<div>where &nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\theta_0\)</span> is the angle of the first (reference) linear polarizer,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle of the second linear polarizer,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\theta\ -\theta_0\)</span> is the relative angle between them, and&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(I_0\)</span> is the maximum intensity of the light passing through both polarizers ( which occurs when&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\theta=\theta_0\)</span>). The offset represents the additional light reaching the photodetector even in the absence of the light passing through the polarizers. If the polarizers are not perfect (ideal), then this offset term will also include any light passing through the polothat is not affected by the polarizers</div>
