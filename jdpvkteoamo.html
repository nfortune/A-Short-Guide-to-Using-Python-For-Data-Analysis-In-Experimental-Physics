<div>where &nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\theta_0\)</span> is the angle of the first (reference) linear polarizer,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle of the second linear polarizer,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\theta\ -\theta_0\)</span> is the relative angle between them,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(I_0\)</span> is the maximum intensity of the light passing through both polarizers ( which occurs when <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\theta=\theta_0\)</span>), and offset is the additional </div>
