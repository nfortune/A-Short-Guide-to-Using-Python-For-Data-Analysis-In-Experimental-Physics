<div></div><div>To try out the&nbsp; Python programs included in this guide&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/9932/articles/11070-how-to-insert-jupyter-and-ipython-notebooks-in-authorea-articles" target="_blank">using a Jupyter webserver hosted by Authorea</a>, click on the&nbsp;<code>&lt;/&gt; Code</code> button found to the left of most of thes figure to reveal the corresponding&nbsp;<code>.ipynb</code> Jupyter notebook and associated data files. Clicking on the notebook file name&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/9932/articles/11070-how-to-insert-jupyter-and-ipython-notebooks-in-authorea-articles" target="_blank">will launch the notebook within a Jupyter web server hosted by Authorea</a>. The notebook can then be run as usual. As with a Mathematica style notebook, clicking on a 'cell' and hitting SHIFT-ENTER will execute the cell and advance to the next one.&nbsp; Alternatively, make modifications to the notebook (for example, adjust a smoothing parameter) then Select&nbsp;<code>Run All</code> from the&nbsp;<code>Cell</code> Menu or&nbsp;<code>Restart &amp; Run All</code> from the&nbsp;<code>Kernel</code> Menu.&nbsp; For additional help, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/binder/Index.ipynb" target="_blank"> online interactive&nbsp; tutorial</a> on how to run Python inside Jupyter (formerly iPython) notebooks.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>Navigation Tip</b>: For a handy table of contents, select&nbsp;<b>Table of Contents</b> from the&nbsp;<b>Document</b> â–¾ pull down menu (upper left of this page).&nbsp;  Clicking on an item in the  table of contents will take you to that section.&nbsp;</div>
