This will reveal the &nbsp;<code>.ipynb</code> Jupyter notebook (and associated data files) containing the Python code used to generate that figure. Clicking on the notebook file name will launch the notebook in a new tab or window within your web browser . The notebook can then be run as usual. This will work for all but the examples using the aptly named Python packages <a href="https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Pint</a> and <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/" target="_blank">Uncertainties</a> for numerical calculations using units and/or uncertainties, as those packages are not currently available on the Authorea Jupyter webserver (but maybe someday?). </div><div></div><div>As with a Mathematica style notebook, clicking on a 'cell' and hitting SHIFT-ENTER will execute the cell and advance to the next one.&nbsp; Alternatively, make modifications to the notebook (for example, adjust a smoothing parameter) then Select&nbsp;<code>Run All</code> from the&nbsp;<code>Cell</code> Menu or&nbsp;<code>Restart &amp; Run All</code> from the&nbsp;<code>Kernel</code> Menu.&nbsp; For additional help, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8sxrynu1/notebooks/binder/Index.ipynb" target="_blank"> online interactive&nbsp; tutorial</a> on how to run Python inside Jupyter (formerly iPython) notebooks.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Many schools host and configure their own Jupyter webservers for Python programming.
