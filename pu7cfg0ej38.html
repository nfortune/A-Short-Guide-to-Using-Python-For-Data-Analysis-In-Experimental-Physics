We conclude that we have sufficiently good agreement between model and experiment at this level of experimental precision   but that further improvements in apparatus design, measurement, and reduction in uncertainty would be merited.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="151285" class="ltx_title_section">Data Smoothing </h1><div></div><div>Data smoothing is a way of reducing time varying noise in measured data so as to reveal the underlying dependence of the measured variable on a different  variable (such as an applied voltage or an external magnetic field). It differs from the signal averaging done by a digital oscilloscope — the  point by point averaging of a  periodic signal to separate a reproducible signal from&nbsp; random noise — in that the measured 'signal' is reproducible but may not periodic, is usually a function of a variable other than time, and, in the examples presented here,&nbsp; is done by us using a computer after the measurement is complete rather than by a computer in the instrument itself.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>There are many ways to go about digitally smoothing data, most of which involve the computer equivalent of low-pass filtering. The SciPy (for scientific python) package offers an exhaustive list of &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html" target="_blank">signal processing functions</a>you may wish to try, but here we illustrate just one: the application of&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="135595" class="ltx_title_section">Interpolation</h1><div></div><div>some text here</div><div></div><h1 data-label="822768" class="ltx_title_section">Working with units and uncertainties</h1><div></div><div>When using Python in place of a calculator, we have the ability to directly include information about dimensions, units and uncertainties in the calculations. When used, these abilities &nbsp;offer the advantage of allowing us to check algebraic calculations, automatically propagate  uncertainties in calculated quantities, and avoid unit conversion errors, but the necessary Python modules are not included in the standard Anaconda Navigator Python installation and must be added by hand (unless already installed as part of a specially configured webserver).&nbsp;</div>
