In most cases, the computer is acting as a digital low pass filter. It differs from an  analog low pass output filter in that the filtering is done by us using a computer after the measurement is complete rather than by the instrument itself. Like  the signal averaging done by a digital oscilloscope — the  point by point averaging of a  periodic signal  — data smoothing seeks to separate random noise from a reproducible signal, but here the measured 'signal' to be smoothed is not assumed to be periodic and is in fact usually a function of a variable other than time.&nbsp; An example would be the measurement of current as a function of applied voltage for a non-ohmic device. </div><div></div><div>The SciPy (for scientific python) package offers an exhaustive list of &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html" target="_blank">signal processing functions</a> useful for the digital filtering.&nbsp; If you have some programming experience in Python, you may wish to design your own filter, perhaps using the lower level scipy.signal&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html" target="_blank">filter design tools</a>.&nbsp; There are, for example, a wide variety of spectral analysis and peak finding routines for frequency data that we will not e.</div><div></div><div>In this article, however,&nbsp; we focus on the use of a particularly useful and easy to use  ready-made filter for <b>data smoothing</b> of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(y\left(x_i\right)\)</span> data equally spaced in&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(x\)</span>:&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_filter" target="_blank">Savitzky-Golay</a> low pass filter&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Savitzky_1964,Steinier_1972}</cite>. This filter works by fitting a subset of  data points adjacent to a particular data point with a low-degree polynomial,  evaluating the polynomial at that point, and then repeating the process for each data point. The set of points centered about a particular data point is called the 'filter window' and the number of points in the filter window is called the&nbsp;<i>window</i>&nbsp;<i>length</i> (although&nbsp;<i>width</i> would seem more apt). The picture here is of a window in cabin looking out upon a nearby data stream. The window&nbsp; reveals a small&nbsp; subset of  points at a time as the data "streams" by. The fit is carried out on the points seen through the window.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>As a bonus, the SciPy Savitzky-Golay filter function <code>scipy.signal.savgol_filter</code> can also be used to numerically <b>differentiate</b> <b>the smoothed data</b> provided the data is "equally spaced."&nbsp; This is a particularly useful feature. For example, we might measure&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(I\left(V\right)\)</span> for a particular non-ohmic device (such as a light bulb or LED) but be more interested theoretically in the differential current&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\frac{dI}{dV}\)</span> as a function of applied voltage&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V\)</span>. As a practical matter, however, the noise in a measurement of &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(I\)</span> as a function of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V\)</span>often precludes a reliable direct calculation of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\frac{dI}{dV}\)</span>. By first smoothing the data using a Savitzky-Golay filter to reduce the noise, however, a meaningful calculation of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\frac{dI}{dV}\)</span> as a function of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V\)</span> can then be computed.&nbsp;</div>
