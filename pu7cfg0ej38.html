We conclude that we have sufficiently good agreement between model and experiment at this level of experimental precision   but that further improvements in apparatus design, measurement, and reduction in uncertainty would be merited.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="151285" class="ltx_title_section">Data Smoothing </h1><div></div><div>Data smoothing is a way of reducing time varying noise in measured data so as to reveal the underlying dependence of the measured variable on a different  variable (such as an applied voltage or an external magnetic field). In most cases, the computer is acting as a digital low pass filter. It differs from an  analog low pass output filter in that the filtering is done by us using a computer after the measurement is complete rather than by the instrument itself. Like  the signal averaging done by a digital oscilloscope — the  point by point averaging of a  periodic signal  — data smoothing seeks to separate random noise from a reproducible signal, but here the measured 'signal' to be smoothed is not assumed to be periodic and is in fact usually a function of a variable other than time.&nbsp; An example would be the measurement of current as a function of applied voltage. </div><div></div><div>The SciPy (for scientific python) package offers an exhaustive list of &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html" target="_blank">signal processing functions</a> useful for the digital filtering of data. Here we illustrate the use of just one particularly easy to use  filter for data smoothing:&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_filter" target="_blank">Savitzky-Golay</a> low pass filter&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Savitzky_1964,Steinier_1972}</cite>, which can be&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.savgol_filter.html" target="_blank">implemented in Python</a> in just one line. This filter works by fitting a subset of  data points adjacent to a particular data point with a low-degree polynomial,  evaluating the polynomial at that point, and then repeating the process for each data point. </div><div></div><div>In the SciPy implementation&nbsp;<code>scipy.signal.savgol_filter</code> , we only need to specify two parameters:&nbsp;</div><ol><li>&nbsp;the <u>number</u> of adjacent data points we wish to include in the fit (called the <b>window_length</b>)</li><li>the&nbsp;<u>order</u> of the polynomial fit, where 1 = linear, 2 = quadratic, and 3 = cubic (called the&nbsp;<b>polyorder)</b>.&nbsp;</li></ol><div>The set of points centered about a particular data point is called the 'filter window' and the number of points in the filter window is called the&nbsp;<i>window</i> <i>length</i> (although <i>width</i> would seem more apt). The picture here is of a window "sliding" in front of the data, revealing only a small subset of data points at a time.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>There are  a few practical constraints: </div><ol><li>the window length must be an odd number</li><li> the polynomial order (1, 2, 3, ...) must be less than the window length</li><li>the data is assumed to be evenly spaced (for example in time, voltage, or magnetic field) </li></ol><div></div><div>As a bonus, the Savitzky-Golay filter function can also be used to numerically differentiate the smoothed data.&nbsp; That requires specification of two additional parameters:&nbsp;the&nbsp;<b>order of the derivative</b> (where 0 = no derivative, 1 = first derivative, 2 = 2nd derivative,...) and the&nbsp;<b>spacing&nbsp;</b>of the samples to which the filter will be applied. For example, when measuring current as a function of applied voltage,&nbsp; (for example, 0.1 for a difference of 0.1 volts&nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="135595" class="ltx_title_section">Interpolation</h1><div></div><div>some text here</div><div></div><h1 data-label="822768" class="ltx_title_section">Working with units and uncertainties</h1><div></div><div>When using Python in place of a calculator, we have the ability to directly include information about dimensions, units and uncertainties in the calculations.
