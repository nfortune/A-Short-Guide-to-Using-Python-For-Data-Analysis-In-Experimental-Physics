<div><i>What these commands do</i>: </div><div></div><div><code>data_file = file_folder + file_name</code> tells Python what the name of the file is and where to find it!&nbsp; Tip: If you have trouble determining how to specify the file_folder location for your data, an easy workaround is to first put the&nbsp;data in the same folder as your Python program, then&nbsp; either (a) set&nbsp;<code>file_folder = ''</code> as in&nbsp; the example above or (b) replace&nbsp;<code>np.loadtxt(file_folder + file_name, ...)</code>  with&nbsp;<code>np.loadtxt(file_name, ...)&nbsp;</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><code>delimiter = ',' </code>tells <code>loadtxt</code> that your data is in comma separated variable format (CSV). The character used to&nbsp; separate one column of data from another is called the 'delimiter.' See the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html?highlight=loadtxt" target="_blank">numpy.loadtxt</a> manual page for details.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><code>skiprows = 1</code> tells&nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code>&nbsp;<i>to skip over one row</i> of text in the CSV file before looking for data to load into arrays. This is because the first row of text contains  names for each column of data&nbsp; instead of data values (as shown in Table&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{296817}</span>).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><code>unpack = True</code> tells&nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code> that the data is in a 'packed' data format (in which each&nbsp;<i>variable</i> corresponds to a different&nbsp;<i>column</i> instead of to a different&nbsp;<i>row</i> )and therefore needs to be 'unpacked' when loaded. This is the typical arrangement for data in spreadsheets. Use <code>unpack = False</code> if the data is in an 'unpacked' data format &nbsp; (in which each&nbsp;<i>variable</i> corresponds to a different&nbsp;<i>column</i> instead of  a different&nbsp;<i>row</i> ).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><code>usecols = (0, 1, 2)</code> says the data you are looking for is in the first 3 columns, which are numbered 0, 1, and 2 (because Python always starts from zero when counting).&nbsp; In our case, since there are only 3 columns of data and we want to use all three, this command is unnecessary. You could leave it out and everything would work just fine for this particular data file.&nbsp; If, however,&nbsp; you wanted to load data from a file with many columns but  only needed data from column number&nbsp; 0, column number 3, and column number 4, you would need to include &nbsp;<code>usecols = (0,3,4)</code> within the&nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code> command.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><code>angle, V_pd, V_pd_error&nbsp; = np.loadtxt(...)&nbsp;</code>tells Numerical Python to create an array called&nbsp;<code>angle</code> and fill it with values from  the first column of data in the CSV spreadsheet file, then create an array called&nbsp;<code>V_pd</code> and fill it with values from the second column of data, and finally create an array called <code>V_pd_error</code> and fill it with values from the third column of data. The result is three shiny new numpy data arrays we can use in our calculations. </div><div></div><div>What if your data is in a different text file format (such as tab delimited)? In that case you can still use &nbsp;<code>loadtxt</code> to import your data as long as you  modify the&nbsp;<code>delimiter</code>command to match the file format.&nbsp; See the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html?highlight=loadtxt" target="_blank">numpy.loadtxt</a> manual page for details.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="883907" class="ltx_title_subsection">saving  data to a CSV file</h2><div>&nbsp;</div><div>For completeness, we now provide an example of how to use  the&nbsp;<code>savetxt</code>  command from Numerical Python (numpy) to&nbsp;<i>save</i>&nbsp;<i>data</i> in csv format. There are admittedly many  ways to save files in spreadsheet format thabut this is the simplest method we've found so far using numpy.&nbsp; For more advanced data handling of spreadsheet data files and/or&nbsp; large data sets, you may wish to use the popular Python Data Analysis Library package called&nbsp;<a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">pandas</a> or the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5)&nbsp; Python interface package&nbsp;<a href="http://www.h5py.org/" target="_blank">h5py</a> .&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Direct numpy import style:&nbsp;</div>
