<div>Note: &nbsp;<code>%matplotlib inline</code> is an iPython '<a href="http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html" target="_blank">magic command</a>' used when running Python within a Jupyter notebook to allow the display of data plots within the notebook.&nbsp; Include it in your code and it will magically do what you need it to do! Just be sure this command <u>precedes</u> the&nbsp; import pyplot command when using pyplot in Jupyter notebooks within Authorea. </div><div></div><div>[For geeks only: standard Python notebook practice is to&nbsp;<i>start</i> with import commands and then&nbsp;<i>follow</i> with&nbsp;  magic commands such as&nbsp;<code>%matplotlib inline&nbsp;</code>. If, however, you do this when attempting to run a Jupyter notebook within Authorea, your notebook will crash. This appears to be&nbsp; because of a bug in the Authorea implementation (as of the time of this writing).&nbsp; The reason is that 'inline' is just one of several possible so-called backends for iPython, and attempting to import pyplot before specifying the backend causes the Authorea server to look for the default 'tk' backend.
