<div>For details, see the&nbsp;<a href="http://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/measurement.html" target="_blank">Pint measurements tutorial</a>.&nbsp; </div><div></div><div>For  general propagation of uncertainty tasks , we use  &nbsp;<a href="https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/" target="_blank">Uncertainties</a>: a Python package  written by Eric. O. Lebigot.&nbsp; Interestingly, Pint uses Uncertainties "under the hood" for calculations invoking <code>.plus_minus()</code>. </div><div></div><div>The uncertainties module returns its result with the uncertainty specified by linear&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty">error propagation theory</a>,  taking into account any direct correlations between variables.&nbsp; Quoting from the uncertainties website, </div><blockquote><div></div><div>The standard deviations and nominal values calculated by this package are thus meaningful approximations as long as <b>uncertainties are “small”</b>. A more precise version of this constraint is that the final calculated functions must have <b>precise linear expansions in the region where the probability distribution of their variables is the largest</b>. Mathematically, this means that the linear terms of the final calculated functions around the nominal values of their variables should be much larger than the remaining higher-order terms over the region of significant probability (because such higher-order contributions are neglected).</div><div> </div><div>For example, calculating <code>x*10</code> with <code>x</code> = 5±3 gives a <i>perfect result</i> since the calculated function is linear. ..</div><div> Another example is <code>sin(0+/-0.01)</code>, for which <code>uncertainties</code> yields a meaningful standard deviation since the sine is quite linear over 0±0.01.  However, <code>cos(0+/-0.01)</code>, yields an approximate standard deviation of 0 because it is parabolic around 0 instead of linear; this might not be precise enough for all applications.</div></blockquote><div></div>
