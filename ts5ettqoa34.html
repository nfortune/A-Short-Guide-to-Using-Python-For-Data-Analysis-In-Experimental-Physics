<div>For details, see the&nbsp;<a href="http://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/measurement.html" target="_blank">Pint measurements tutorial</a>.&nbsp; </div><div></div><div>For  general propagation of uncertainty tasks , we use  &nbsp;<a href="https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/" target="_blank">Uncertainties</a>: a Python package  written by Eric. O. Lebigot, the same package Pint uses "under the hood" for calculations invoking <code>.plus_minus()</code>. The uncertainties module returns its result with the uncertainty specified by linear&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty">error propagation theory</a>,  taking into account any direct correlations between variables.&nbsp; Quoting from the uncertainties website, </div><blockquote><div></div><div>The standard deviations and nominal values calculated by this package are thus meaningful approximations as long as <b>uncertainties are “small”</b>. A more precise version of this constraint is that the final calculated functions must have <b>precise linear expansions in the region where the probability distribution of their variables is the largest</b>. Mathematically, this means that the linear terms of the final calculated functions around the nominal values of their variables should be much larger than the remaining higher-order terms over the region of significant probability (because such higher-order contributions are neglected).</div><div> </div><div>For example, calculating&nbsp;<code>x*10</code> with&nbsp;<code>x</code> = 5±3 gives a&nbsp;<i>perfect result</i> since the calculated function is linear...&nbsp; Another example is&nbsp;<code>sin(0+/-0.01)</code>, for which&nbsp;<code>uncertainties</code> yields a meaningful standard deviation since the sine is quite linear over 0±0.01.  However,&nbsp;<code>cos(0+/-0.01)</code>, yields an approximate standard deviation of 0 because it is parabolic around 0 instead of linear; this might not be precise enough for all applications.</div></blockquote><div>Here we provide a demonstration of how to use <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/" target="_blank">Uncertainties</a> to calculate the uncertainty values (error bars) for the data shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{525200}</span>). </div><div></div><div>First, <i>import the data and assign values, including specification of uncertainties (!)&nbsp; </i>to&nbsp; the input parameters&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_0\)</span>,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_1\)</span>,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\theta_0\)</span> and the data array&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\theta\)</span>. </div>
