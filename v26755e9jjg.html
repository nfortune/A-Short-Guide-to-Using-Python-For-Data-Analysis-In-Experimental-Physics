<div>Below I have included a partial screen shot from a Jupyter notebook running Pint. Click on the&nbsp; &lt;/&gt; Code button to the left of the image below&nbsp;to reveal the complete notebook, which includes an extended set of sample Python calculations using Pint for unit-based calculations and conversions (for variables and arrays) plus examples of&nbsp;various formatting tricks for printed output. For further help, see the<a href="http://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html" target="_blank"> Pint tutorial</a>.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div>
