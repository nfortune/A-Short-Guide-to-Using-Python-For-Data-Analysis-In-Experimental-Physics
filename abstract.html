<div>Common  signal processing tasks&nbsp;in the numerical handling of experimental data include interpolation, smoothing, and propagation of uncertainty. A comparison of  experimental results to a theoretical model further requires curve fitting, the plotting of functions and data,&nbsp; and a determination of the goodness of fit. Making the experimental resultsreproducible requires open access to the original data &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
