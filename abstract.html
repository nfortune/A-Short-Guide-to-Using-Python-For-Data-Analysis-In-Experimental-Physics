<div>Common  signal processing tasks&nbsp;in the numerical handling of experimental data include interpolation, smoothing, and propagation of uncertainty. A comparison of  experimental results to a theoretical model further requires curve fitting, the plotting of functions and data,&nbsp; and a determination of the goodness of fit. These tasks often typically require an interactive, exploratory approach to the data, yet for the results  to be reliable, the original data needs to be freely available easily accessi and resulting analysis readily reproducible. In this article, we show how to use Python&nbsp;</div>
