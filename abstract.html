<div>Common  signal processing tasks&nbsp;in the numerical handling of experimental data include interpolation, smoothing, and propagation of uncertainty. A comparison of  experimental results to a theoretical model further requires curve fitting, the plotting of functions and data,&nbsp; and a determination of the goodness of fit. These tasks often typically require a step by step, interactive, exploratory approach, yet for the results  to be reli, the original data needs to be freely available and the analysis steps&nbsp;</div>
