<div>Experimentally, we can determine&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V_1\)</span> from&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V_{photodiode}\)</span> by measuring the statistical spread in the minimum value of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_{pd}\)</span> (when&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\phi=\ \frac{\pi}{2}\)</span> radians and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V\ =\ \delta V_1\)</span>).&nbsp; We can then determine&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V_0\)</span> by measuring the corresponding statistical spread in the maximum value of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_{pd}\)</span> (when&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\phi=\ 0\)</span> and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V_{pd}=\sqrt{\left(\delta V_0\right)^2+\left(\delta V_1\right)^2}\)</span>). In contrast, the uncertainty&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta\phi\)</span> depends on our own judgement as to how small a change in angle can be physically resolved with the apparatus at hand, assuming the polarizer angles are mechanically set.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Having done so, the first computational challenge here&nbsp; is that even after experimentally determining &nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V_0\)</span>,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V_1\)</span>, and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta\phi\)</span>, solving for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V\)</span> requires knowledge of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_0\)</span>. Since the point of curve fitting to the data is to determine&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_0\)</span>, &nbsp; how do we determine the numerical value for &nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V_{pd}\left(\theta\right)\)</span> n to then find a best estimate of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_0\)</span>. This is not the impasse that it might seem, however, as we always need to supply an initial guess for our curve-fit parameters. The solution is to take the values provided by the curve fit as the initial guesses for a second round of curve fitting, and continue until the result is self-consistent (that is, the output value matches the input value within the reported uncertainty).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The second challenge is that the result requires recalculation for every value of&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\phi\)</span>, hence the need to have this done by the computer.  </div><div></div><div>Wouldn't it be nice to have Python do this for you from your data? </div><div></div><h1 data-label="662059" class="ltx_title_section">Installing Python&nbsp;</h1><div></div><h2 data-label="140511" class="ltx_title_subsection">Using the Anaconda Navigator  installer</h2>
