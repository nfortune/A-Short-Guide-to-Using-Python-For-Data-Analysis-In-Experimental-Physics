<div>Experimentally, we can determine <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V_1\)</span> from <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V_{photodiode}\)</span></div><div></div><div>The first challenge here&nbsp; is that even after experimentally determining &nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V_0\)</span>,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V_1\)</span>, and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta\phi\)</span>, solving for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V\)</span> requires knowledge of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_0\)</span>, but in curve-fitting, we need to&nbsp;  supply a numerical value for &nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\delta V\)</span> to then find a best estimate of <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(V_0\)</span>. This is not the impasse that it might seem, however, as we always need to supply an initial guess for our curve-fit parameters. The solution is to take the values provided by the curve fit as the initial guesses for a second round of curve fitting, and continue until the result is self-consistent (that is, the output value matches the input value within the reported uncertainty). </div><div></div><div>The second challenge is that the result requires recalculation for every value of&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\phi\)</span>, hence the need to have this done by the computer.  </div><div></div><div>Wouldn't it be nice to have Python do this for you from your data? </div><div></div><h1 data-label="662059" class="ltx_title_section">Installing Python&nbsp;</h1><div></div><h2 data-label="140511" class="ltx_title_subsection">Using the Anaconda Navigator  installer</h2>
