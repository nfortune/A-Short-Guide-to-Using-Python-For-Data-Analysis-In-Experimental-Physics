<div>Ideally, if the model describes the data AND the estimated uncertainty of each point has been accurately determined, the reduced chi-square value would be approximately equal to one (for large&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\nu\)</span>) and the fractional probability of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\chi^2\)</span> values larger and smaller than that measured would both be approximately 50%.&nbsp; Statistically, however, we expect some reasonable random variation from the expected mean value of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\nu\)</span> for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\chi_{\min}^2\)</span>, meaning that statisticians generally will not reject the "null hypothesis" (that the model describes the data and all deviations can be reasonably attributed to expected random variation) as long as&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\chi_{\min}^2\)</span> is within 2 standard deviations (&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(2\sigma\)</span> )&nbsp; of the mean value. Here,  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\chi_{mean}^2\ =\ \nu\)</span> and&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\sigma_{\nu}=\sqrt{2\nu}\)</span>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Hughes2010}</cite> , so the criterion can be reexpressed as </div>
