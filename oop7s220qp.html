If the error is random, the points should be evenly and randomly distributed, with 2/3 of the points within 1 standard deviation of zero and 95% within 2 standard deviations. Overall, the residuals appear consistent with the assumption of random variation in the data. </div><div></div><div><b>Chi-square:</b> According to the chi-square analysis, however,&nbsp;either the fit is&nbsp;too&nbsp;good&nbsp;or the uncertainty estimate is, on average, too large&nbsp; to be true! We interpret that to mean here not that the model doesn't describe the data but that instead,  the uncertainty in the data is less than reported (on average). We will revisit this  later when we consider propagation of uncertainty in section&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{393002}</span>.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="822768" class="ltx_title_section">Working with measurement data</h1><div></div><div>When using Python in place of a calculator, we have the ability to directly include information about dimensions, units and uncertainties in the calculations. When used, these abilities &nbsp;offer the advantage of allowing us to check algebraic calculations, automatically propagate  uncertainties in calculated quantities, and avoid unit conversion errors, but the necessary Python modules are not included in the standard Anaconda Navigator Python installation and must be added by hand (unless already installed as part of a specially configured webserver).&nbsp;</div>
