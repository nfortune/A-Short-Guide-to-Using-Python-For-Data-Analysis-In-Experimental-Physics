Either we didn't take enough data points at each polarization angle to accurately establish the measurement uncertainty or we haven't adequately taken into a</div><h1 data-label="822768" class="ltx_title_section">Working with measurement data</h1><div></div><div>When using Python in place of a calculator, we have the ability to directly include information about dimensions, units and uncertainties in the calculations. When used, these abilities &nbsp;offer the advantage of allowing us to check algebraic calculations, automatically propagate  uncertainties in calculated quantities, and avoid unit conversion errors, but the necessary Python modules are not included in the standard Anaconda Navigator Python installation and must be added by hand (unless already installed as part of a specially configured webserver).&nbsp;</div>
