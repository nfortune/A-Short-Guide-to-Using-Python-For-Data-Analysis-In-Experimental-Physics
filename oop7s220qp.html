<div>Here are the results for the fit shown in Fig. <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{680456}</span>: </div><div></div><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><div>chi-square test value = 7.708</div><div>degrees of freedom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 25 - 3 = 22</div><div>reduced chi-square&nbsp; &nbsp; = 0.350</div><div>fractional probability = 0.2% </div></blockquote><div>Our conclusion?&nbsp; The deviation of the fit from the data around 150 degrees suggests some systematic error (or fluctuation in what we were assuming was a constant background) but overall seems plausible. According to the chi-square analysis, however,&nbsp;<i>the fit is</i>&nbsp;<i>too</i>&nbsp;<i>good</i> to be true! We interpret that to mean here not that the model doesn't describe the data but that instead, we have overestimated the uncertainty in the data for most data points. We might, for example, have expected the uncertainties for most points to be similar, but that isn't what we determined experimentally. It is possible we didn't take enough data points at each polarization angle to accurately establish the measurement uncertainty from our data sample.&nbsp; And if we take account into account the fundamental sources of uncertainty, our propagated uncertainty might . We will address this again later when we consider propagation of uncertainty in section&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{393002}</span>.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="822768" class="ltx_title_section">Working with measurement data</h1><div></div><div>When using Python in place of a calculator, we have the ability to directly include information about dimensions, units and uncertainties in the calculations. When used, these abilities &nbsp;offer the advantage of allowing us to check algebraic calculations, automatically propagate  uncertainties in calculated quantities, and avoid unit conversion errors, but the necessary Python modules are not included in the standard Anaconda Navigator Python installation and must be added by hand (unless already installed as part of a specially configured webserver).&nbsp;</div>
