When used, these abilities &nbsp;offer the advantage of allowing us to check algebraic calculations, automatically propagate  uncertainties in calculated quantities, and avoid unit conversion errors, but the necessary Python modules are not included in the standard Anaconda Navigator Python installation and must be added by hand if needed. (Note for Smith students:&nbsp;  these additional modules&nbsp; are already installed on  the Smith Physics Jupyter webserver&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://jove.smith.edu">https://jove.smith.edu</a> and the classroom computers for PHY 350)</div>
