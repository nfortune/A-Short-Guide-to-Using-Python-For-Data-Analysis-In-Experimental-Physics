After installation, restart and launch Anaconda Navigator. You should then be able to launch a Jupyter notebook and be good t</div><div></div><div>Still prefer to build your own clean, lean, and mean Python installation and willing to blaze (and maintain) your own trail ? Here's&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/chapters/AppendixA.pdf" target="_blank">a guide to getting started</a> that results in an exceptionally lean installation suitable for use in computational physics. If you want to run the example code&nbsp; provided here on your own computer, however, you will also want to install  the&nbsp;<a href="https://ipython.org/" target="_blank">iPython</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter</a>,&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html" target="_blank">Scipy</a> packages&nbsp; (at a minimum).&nbsp; Other packages may be needed as well; one surefire but tedious way to do this is to attempt to run the code and then let the computer tell you what you are missing!&nbsp;</div><div></div><div> Finally, if&nbsp; you are an experienced and independent-minded Python programmer (and would you have read the previous paragraph if you weren't?), you may ask, "Why Jupyter?"&nbsp; Why not use the Python or iPython command line directly, use a bare-bones editor such as IDLE , or a more comprehensive MATLAB like programming environment like Spyder? If you are in one of our  Smith Physics courses, the answer is because we use Jupyter notebooks not only to run Python code&nbsp; but also&nbsp;  to generate a partially "self-documenting" electronic lab notebook as we do so. &nbsp;If you are doing a lot of programming requiring extensive re-writing and debugging, you may prefer to first work in&nbsp; development environment like Spyder, then run the finished product within Jupyter to generate a notebook version of the data analysis, but in  experimental physics, you still need to keep an comprehensive electronic notebook of your instrument setup,&nbsp; measurement, and data analysis steps! Finally, note that the command line&nbsp; is convenient for quick calculations and tests of code but is inadequate for serious editing and debugging, and does not provide a reproducible record of your results. &nbsp; As a calculator it is great but as a notebook it is not! There's really no good reason as an experimental physicist with a computer at your disposal not to use an electronic notebook instead of a calculator in the first place. Get with the program!&nbsp; :) </div><div></div><h2 data-label="140511" class="ltx_title_subsection">Using the Anaconda Navigator  installer</h2>
