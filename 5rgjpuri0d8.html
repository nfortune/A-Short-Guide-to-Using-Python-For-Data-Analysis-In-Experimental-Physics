<div>Two of the most popular distributions and installers are from&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" target="_blank">Anaconda&nbsp;</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/" target="_blank">Enthought</a>.&nbsp; Both are freely available for Mac OS, Linux, and Windows .&nbsp; Either should do what you need. That said,  the examples presented below for installation of additional Python packages assume the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" target="_blank">Anaconda Navigator</a>.&nbsp; </div><div>Also, if you are using this for a Smith Physics course, we ask you to use Anaconda Navigator if you wish us to be able to provide support with installation and programming (since that is what we are using). </div><div></div><div>Download the latest version of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" target="_blank">Anaconda Navigator</a> here.&nbsp; Be sure to chose the Python 3.x version of Python (not the older   version 2). All the examples provided here assume the use of Python 3. </div><div></div><div>Still prefer to build your own clean, lean, and mean Python installation and willing to blaze (and maintain) your own trail ? Here's&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/chapters/AppendixA.pdf" target="_blank">a guide to getting started</a>. If you want to run the examples provided here in the code blocks on your own computer, you will also need the iPython, Jupyter,&nbsp; and Scipy packages&nbsp; (at a minimum). </div><div></div><div>Finally, note that many of the Python commands in the code blocks included in this article can be run from the iPython command line, within a Jupyter notebook (which resembles a Mathematica-like notebook environment), or in Spyder (which resembles a MATLAB like environment) . The command line is convenient for quick calculations and tests of code but is inadequate for serious editing and debugging.&nbsp; In our Smith Physics courses, we use Jupyter notebooks both&nbsp; to run Python code&nbsp; and  to generate a "self-documenting" electronic lab notebook as we do so.   If you are doing a lot of programming requiring extensive re-writing and debugging, however, yinstall Spyder to aid in the writing and debugging of your code, but it is not necessary for the examples provided here.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h2 data-label="140511" class="ltx_title_subsection">Using the Anaconda Navigator  installer</h2>
