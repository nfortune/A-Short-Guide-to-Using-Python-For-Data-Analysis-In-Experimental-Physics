<div>Two of the most popular distributions and installers are from&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" target="_blank">Anaconda&nbsp;</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/" target="_blank">Enthought</a>.&nbsp; Both are freely available for Mac OS, Linux, and Windows .&nbsp; Either should do what you need. That said,  the examples presented below for installation of additional Python packages assume the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" target="_blank">Anaconda Navigator</a>.&nbsp; </div><div>Also, if you are using this for a Smith Physics course, we ask you to use Anaconda Navigator if you wish us to be able to provide support with installation and programming (since that is what we are using). </div><div></div><div>Download the latest version of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" target="_blank">Anaconda Navigator</a> here.&nbsp; Be sure to chose the Python 3.x version of Python (not the older   version 2). All the examples provided here assume the use of Python 3. </div><div></div><div>Still prefer to build your own clean, lean, and mean Python installation and willing to blaze (and maintain) your own trail ? Here's&nbsp;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/chapters/AppendixA.pdf" target="_blank">a guide to getting started</a> that results in an exceptionally lean installation suitable for use in computational physics. If you want to run the example code&nbsp; provided here on your own computer, however, you will also want to install  the&nbsp;<a href="https://ipython.org/" target="_blank">iPython</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter</a>,&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html" target="_blank">Scipy</a> packages&nbsp; (at a minimum).&nbsp; Other packages may be needed as well; one surefire but tedious way to do this is to attempt to run the code and then let the computer tell you what you are missing!&nbsp;</div><div></div><div> If you are an experienced Python programmer, you may ask, Why Jupyter? Why not a bare-bones editor such as IDLE or a more MATLAB like programming environment like Spyder? If you are in one of our  Smith Physics courses, the answer is because we use Jupyter notebooks not only to run Python code&nbsp; but also&nbsp;  to generate a partially "self-documenting" electronic lab notebook as we do so.&nbsp;The command line is convenient for quick calculations and tests of code but is inadequate for serious editing and debugging, and does not provide a reproducible record of your results. &nbsp; &nbsp;If you are doing a lot of programming requiring extensive re-writing and debugging, you may prefer a development environment like Spyder, but it is not needed for the examples provided here.&nbsp;</div>
