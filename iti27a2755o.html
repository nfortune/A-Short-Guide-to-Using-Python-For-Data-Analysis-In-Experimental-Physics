<div>As can be seen by trying out the Jupyter notebook containing the Python code used to generate Fig.<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{987576}</span> , significantly increasing the window width increases the degree of smoothing, causing small features in the original 'clean signal' to disappear; significantly decreasing the window width decreasing the degree of smoothing, causing artificial features (arising from the noise) to emerge. Increasing the order of the polynomial decreases the noise reduction but is needed for if there is significant data curvature over the width of the smoothing window.  To try, this click first on the &lt;/&gt; Code button, then on the file name Smooth_and_differentiate.ipynb to open and view  the underlying&nbsp; Jupyter notebook containing the Python code used to generate this figure.&nbsp; ALternaOnce opened, you can vary the smoothing parameters and re-run the notebook to see how the choice of window width and polynomial fit order changes the filtered signal.</div><div></div><div>Since for real experimental data the original 'clean signal' is unknown, the degree of smoothing is a matter of judgement! A comparison of several different smoothing values (not shown) can be useful in discerning the effective resolution of your processed data (and any derivatives) . &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
