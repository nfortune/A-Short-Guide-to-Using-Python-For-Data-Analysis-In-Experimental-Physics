<div>In general,  increasing the window width increases the degree of smoothing, causing small features in the original 'clean signal' to disappear;  decreasing the window width decreasing the degree of smoothing, causing artificial features (arising from the noise) to emerge. Increasing the order of the polynomial while holding the window width constant decreases the degree of noise reduction but is needed for if there is significant data curvature over the width of the smoothing window.  To see this for yourself, this click first on the &lt;/&gt; Code button, then on the file name&nbsp;<code>Smooth_and_differentiate.ipynb</code> to open and view  the underlying&nbsp; Jupyter notebook containing the Python code used to generate this figure.&nbsp; Once opened, you can vary the smoothing parameters and re-run the notebook to see the changes. You can also download the notebook to your own computer as a template. </div><div></div><div></div><div>Everyone has there own favorite smoothing routine. The Savitky-Golay method presented here is not necessarily  better than any other smoothing routine but is often  a very good place to start!
